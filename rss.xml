meeting overload, and reduced flexibility. Retaining your high performers - and developing new ones - is critical in
today&apos;s uncertain, fast-paced business environment. Here&apos;s how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tip is adapted from
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2024/06/3-ways-to-build-a-culture-that-lets-high-performers-thrive&quot;&gt;3 Ways to Build a Culture That Lets High Performers Thrive&lt;/a&gt;&quot; by Lindsay
McGregor and Neel Doshi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minimize Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut down on unnecessary meetings to free up your employees&apos; time for truly impactful work. This means establishing a
simple, predictable weekly meeting schedule for your team, as well as optimizing your one-on-ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measure Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use surveys regularly to assess your team members&apos; motivation and understand what excites or creates stress for them.
For example, ask: What habits does the team want to improve? What are some specific ideas to improve those habits? Then
create quarterly improvement plans to address any pain points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mentor High-Potential Employees on Key Skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure your high performers feel challenged and your developing employees are growing, schedule quarterly
skill-development meetings for each of your direct reports. Use that time to identify one concrete, high-leverage skill
(think problem-solving or leadership) for them to improve in the next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

No</title><link>https://leadership.qubitpi.org/posts/managing-tech-assets-common-lib-or-not/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://leadership.qubitpi.org/posts/managing-tech-assets-common-lib-or-not/</guid><description>Managing Tech Assets - Is a Common Library a Good Idea? No</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;A Story - A Person Created a Common Library and Then...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Embarrassingly I introduced a &quot;common&quot; library, named as such, in a team environment a couple of decades back.
I didn&apos;t really understand the dynamics back then of what could happen in a loosely-coordinated team setting in just a
matter of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I introduced it I thought I made it clear and also documented that it&apos;s for things we&apos;d all agree we find useful on
a daily basis, that it&apos;s intended to be a minimalist library, and that the library should depend on nothing else besides
the standard library so that it&apos;s as easy to deploy as possible in new projects. My thinking at the time was that it was
our own little extension to the standard library for things that, in our particular domain, we found useful on a daily
basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it started off well enough. We started off with a math library (&lt;code&gt;common/math*&lt;/code&gt;) of routines which we all used on a
daily basis, since we were working on computer graphics which was often heavy on the linear algebra. And since we were
often interoping with C code, we agreed on some useful utility functions like find_index which, unlike std::find in C++,
would return an index to an element found in a sequence instead of an iterator which mimicked how our C functions worked
-- things of this sort -- a little bit eclectic but minimalist and widely used enough to remain familiar and practical
to everyone, and instant familiarity is an extremely important criteria as I see it in trying to make anything that is
&quot;common&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; since if it truly is &quot;common&quot;, it should have that familiar quality about it as a result of its
wide adoption and daily usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over time the design intentions of the library slipped out of my fingers as people started to add things they used
personally that they merely thought might be of use to someone else, only to find no one else using it. And later
someone started adding functions that depended on OpenGL for common GL-related routines. Further on we adopted Qt and
people started adding code that depended on Qt, so already the common library was dependent on two external libraries.
At some point someone added common shader routines which was dependent on our application-specific shader library, and
at that point you couldn&apos;t even deploy it in a new project without bringing in Qt, OGL, and our application-specific
shader library and writing a non-trivial build script for your project. So it turned into this eclectic, interdependent
mess. Later on people even added GUI-dependent code to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&apos;ve also found by debating what should and shouldn&apos;t go into this library that what is considered &quot;common&quot; can
easily turn into a very subjective idea if you don&apos;t set a very hard line rule that what&apos;s &quot;common&quot; is what everyone
tends to find useful on a daily basis. Any loosening of the standards and it quickly degrades from things everyone finds
useful on a daily basis to something a single developer finds useful that might have the possibility of being beneficial
to someone else, and at that point the library degrades into an eclectic mess really fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But furthermore when you reach that point, some developers can start adding things for the simple reason that they don&apos;t
like the programming language. They might not like the syntax of a for loop or a function call, at which point the
library is starting to get filled with things that&apos;s just fighting the fundamental syntax of the language, replacing a
couple of lines of straightforward code which isn&apos;t really duplicating any logic down to a single terse line of exotic
code only familiar to the developer who introduced such a shorthand. Then such a developer might start adding more
functionality to the common library implemented using such shorthands, at which point significant sections of the common
library become interwoven with these exotic shorthands which might seem beautiful and intuitive to the developer who
introduced it but ugly and foreign and hard to understand for everyone else. And at that point I think you know that any
hope of making something truly &quot;common&quot; is lost, since &quot;common&quot; and &quot;unfamiliar&quot; are polar opposite ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&apos;s all kinds of cans of worms there, at least in a loosely-coordinated team environment, with a library with
ambitions as broad and as generalized as just &quot;commonly-used stuff&quot;. And while the underlying problem might have been
the loose coordination above all else, at least multiple libraries intended to serve a more singular purpose, like a
library intended to provide math routines and nothing else, probably wouldn&apos;t degrade as significantly in terms of its
design purity and dependencies as a &quot;common&quot; library. So in retrospect I think it would be much better to err on the
side of libraries which have much more clear design intentions. I&apos;ve also found over the years that narrow in purpose
and narrow in applicability are radically different ideas. Often the most widely applicable things are the narrowest and
most singular in purpose, since you can then say, &quot;aha, this is exactly what I need&quot;, as opposed to wading through an
eclectic library of disparate functionality trying to see if it has something you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I&apos;m admittedly at least a little bit impractical and care maybe a bit too much about aesthetics, but the way I tend
to perceive my idea of a library&apos;s quality (and maybe even &quot;beauty&quot;) is judged more by its weakest link than its
strongest, in a similar way that if you presented me the most appetitizing food in the world but, on the same plate, put
something rotting on there that smells really bad, I tend to want to reject the entire plate. And if you&apos;re like me in
that regard and make something that invites all sorts of additions as something called &quot;common&quot;, you might find yourself
looking at that analogical plate with something rotting on the side. So likewise I think it&apos;s good if a library is
organized and named and documented in a way such that it doesn&apos;t invite more and more and more additions over time. And
that can even apply to your personal creations, since I&apos;ve certainly created some rotten stuff here and there, and it
&quot;taints&quot; a lot less if it&apos;s not being added to the biggest plate. Separating things out into small, very singular
libraries has a tendency to better decouple code as well, if only by the sheer virtue that it becomes far less
convenient to start coupling everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip
Code deduplication has been hammered into me over the years but I feel like I should try it this time around.
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I might suggest in your case is to start to take it easy on code deduplication. I&apos;m not saying to copy and paste
big snippets of poorly-tested, error-prone code around or anything of this sort, or duplicating huge amounts of
non-trivial code that has a decent probability of requiring changes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But especially if you are of the mindset to create a &quot;common&quot; library, for which I assume your desire is to create
something widely-applicable, highly reusable, and perhaps ideally something you find just as useful today as you do a
decade from now, then sometimes you might even need or want some duplication to achieve this elusive quality. Because
the duplication might actually serve as a decoupling mechanism. It&apos;s like if you want to separate a video player from an
MP3 player, then you at least have to duplicate some things like batteries and hard drives. They can&apos;t share these
things or else they&apos;re indivisibly coupled and cannot be used independently of each other, and at that point people
might not be interested in the device anymore if all they want to do is play MP3s. But some time after you split these
two devices apart, you might find that the MP3 player can benefit from a different battery design or smaller hard drive
than the video player, at which point you&apos;re no longer duplicating anything; what initially started out as duplication
to allow this interdependent device to split into two separate, independent devices might later turn out to yield
designs and implementations that are no longer redundant at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s worth considering things from the perspective of the one using a library. Would you actually want to use a library
that minimizes code duplication? Chances are that you won&apos;t because one that does will naturally depend on other
libraries. And those other libraries might depend on other libraries to avoid duplicating their code, and so on, until
you might need to import/link 50 different libraries to just to get some basic functionality like loading and playing an
audio file, and that becomes very unwieldy. Meanwhile if such an audio library deliberately chose to duplicate some
things here and there to achieve its independence, it becomes so much easier to use in new projects, and chances are
that it won&apos;t need to be updated nearly as often since it won&apos;t need to change as a result of one its dependent external
libraries changing which might be trying to fulfill a much more generalized purpose than what the audio library needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sometimes it&apos;s worth deliberately choosing to duplicate a little bit (consciously, never out of laziness -- actually
out of diligence) in order to decouple a library and make it independent because, through that independence, it achieves
a wider range of practical applicability and even stability (no more afferent couplings). If you want to design the most
reusable libraries possible that will last you from one project to the next and over the years, then on top of narrowing
its scope to the minimum, I would actually suggest considering duplicating a little bit here. And naturally write unit
tests and make sure it&apos;s really thoroughly tested and reliable at what it&apos;s doing. This is only for the libraries that
you really want to take the time to generalize to a point that goes far beyond a single project.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2nd paragraph. &lt;em&gt;Italic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;monospace&lt;/code&gt;. Itemized lists
look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the other one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block quotes are
written like so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can span multiple paragraphs,
if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., &quot;it&apos;s all
in chapters 12--14&quot;). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An h2 header&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a numbered list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;third item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here&apos;s a code sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Let me re-iterate ...
for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;define foobar() {
    print &quot;Welcome to flavor country!&quot;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(which makes copying &amp;amp; pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An h3 header&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a nested list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, get these ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carrots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;celery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lentils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boil some water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dump everything in the pot and follow
this algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; find wooden spoon
 uncover pot
 stir
 cover pot
 balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
 wait 10 minutes
 goto first step (or shut off burner when done)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://foo.bar&quot;&gt;a website&lt;/a&gt;, to a &lt;a href=&quot;local-doc.html&quot;&gt;local
doc&lt;/a&gt;, and to a &lt;a href=&quot;#an-h2-header&quot;&gt;section heading in the current
doc&lt;/a&gt;. Here&apos;s a footnote [^1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: Footnote text goes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tables can look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;size material color&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9 leather brown
10 hemp canvas natural
11 glass transparent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they&apos;re made of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keyword text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;red Sunsets, apples, and
other red or reddish
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;green Leaves, grass, frogs
and other things it&apos;s
not easy being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A horizontal rule follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a definition list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;apples
: Good for making applesauce.
oranges
: Citrus!
tomatoes
: There&apos;s no &quot;e&quot; in tomatoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a &quot;line block&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| Line one
| Line too
| Line tree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and images can be specified like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$&lt;/p&gt;

However, they may face
stiff resistance from employees when adopting new tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons workers resist new technology, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling excluded from the decision-making process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of communication from management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to see the benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resenting perceived interference from management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of confidence around technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to see a use for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling threatened and unappreciated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asking Employees for Their Input&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s start by tackling the first reason workers resist new technology: feeling excluded from the decision-making
process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you rush out and buy new tech, you need to consult your employees. This doesn&apos;t have to be a formal interview.
For instance, you could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send a questionnaire to employees&lt;/strong&gt; about the tech they currently use and what would make their job easier. Is their
solution the same as yours? Your idea of the best team task management software may not be the same as that of your
employees. Use software such as Qualtrics or SurveyMonkey to create easily accessible surveys that can be sent across
the company. By sending a questionnaire straight to employees&apos; inboxes, you can quickly collect valuable feedback on
what software would benefit them most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimize tech for each employee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking employees for their input not only increases the likelihood of them using the new tech but also shows that you
appreciate them. And employees who feel appreciated are more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Communicating the Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy combats two causes of worker resistance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of communication from management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to see the benefits of new technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency is vital when bringing in tech that affects how employees do their job. Open dialog is the best way to
promote transparency and ease the transition from old to new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider hosting a video meeting to communicate the benefits of the new technology and encourage questions and feedback
so you can deal with any issues that may arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, provide a place where employees can continue to ask questions and where you can provide updates.
Create a group on the instant messaging software you use in-house and send regular email updates to keep employees in
the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many businesses are failing to promote transparency through open dialog. There&apos;s a big difference between companies
that outperform their rivals and those that don&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees are more likely to accept new tech if you answer the question, &quot;What&apos;s in it for me?&quot; So, if you think cloud
computing will make remote sales management easier, tell people! Explain how the new tech will benefit them, and do your
best to address their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important with less tech-savvy employees since they&apos;re the ones who&apos;ll feel the most unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recruiting Tech-Savvy Volunteers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s imagine you&apos;re looking to adopt software to help build your affiliate marketing sales funnel. Recruiting a few
volunteers from your marketing team to try out the software could answer questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How easy is it to use the software?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will the software benefit the marketing team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&apos;s the best way to sell it to the rest of the team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will it create new challenges or address existing ones?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use these insights to shape how you go about the rest of your rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use these tech-savvy volunteers to promote the new technology to their colleagues. Maybe they could be the
ones to host the video meeting to introduce the technology to the team. This will minimize any resentment employees feel
about your perceived interference in how they work. These volunteers can also help with the next strategy: providing
adequate training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Providing Adequate Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training boosts employees&apos; confidence around unfamiliar tech and makes them more likely to accept it. You should
schedule training sessions both during and after the introduction of the new tech to help everyone get familiar with it.
But remember - when it comes to learning, there&apos;s no such thing as one-size-fits-all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more training tips to think about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make training fun&lt;/strong&gt;. Employees will retain more information if the training is enjoyable. They&apos;re also more likely
to attend!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Split training up&lt;/strong&gt;. Don&apos;t give employees all the training in one go. Splitting training into shorter chunks will
help keep them engaged. Consider using microlearning software as employees can learn and test their knowledge in small
bite-size chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an SOP&lt;/strong&gt;. Create a standard operating procedure document that employees can refer to if they forget any of
the training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If in doubt, think about what helps you learn. And then do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Guided Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t sit employees down and talk at them for two hours. Hold workshops that combine training with doing. For example,
instructors could give employees bite-sized chunks of information. Then employees could try it out for themselves. This
kind of guided learning helps employees remember what to do because they&apos;ve actually done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailor workshops by individual, so employees only learn what they need for their job, not everyone else&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also bear in mind that some employees are less tech-savvy than others. If your company is adopting a cloud
communications platform, some employees will know all about it, while others will be wondering, &quot;what is cloud
communications&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good time to bring in your tech-savvy volunteers. Pair them with colleagues who are less confident with
technology so they can help their colleagues get up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let Employees Learn on Their Own&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some employees need hand-holding at every stage during training. Others learn best on their own. In fact, more and more
workers in all age groups want fully independent learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&apos;s important to facilitate self-guided learning. You can do this by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating playground environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providing online resources&lt;/strong&gt; for employees to work through if they need a refresher. Try to provide a mixture of
resources, like step-by-step guides, infographics, audio recordings, and videos. All of these could be managed through
a learning management system (LMS) which will help keep track of all training and enable you to identify any areas
where you can improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Giving Employees a Reason to Use It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes employees may still need convincing of the need to use new technology. Ongoing training can help with this,
but so can applying the principles of A/B testing ideas (comparing one version of an asset with another) to your
rollout. You might try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holding a workshop&lt;/strong&gt; where everyone tries out the new tech and compares it to the old. A virtual classroom is a
useful option. It provides an engaging environment for learners to develop their skills and enables you to gather
vital data on how successful the training is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a friendly competition&lt;/strong&gt; where one team uses the old tech and one team uses the new tech to see which is
better. Use training software with integrated gamification with leaderboards and reward badges for encouraging
employees to participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing incentives for people to use the new tech can also help. A small bonus or even an office trophy could be all
it takes to encourage people to try it out. And keeping up a dialog will help you quickly address any concerns or
issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Celebrating Success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as your company should have a customer-centric culture, it should also have an employee-centric culture. This means
celebrating success, no matter how small. If an employee does something in record time because of the new tech, make
sure everyone knows about it! Your marketing department can promote your business to employees as well as customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also important to reward employees for their contributions. Employees who make the best use of the new tech should
be paid accordingly, especially if they boost the business&apos;s revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If employees know you reward success, they&apos;ll be more motivated to adopt the new tech. They&apos;ll also be more likely to
adopt new tech in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees resist new technology for all sorts of reasons. Understanding those reasons is the first step to helping them
adapt to new technology. The next step is using the tried-and-tested strategies outlined in this post&lt;/p&gt;
