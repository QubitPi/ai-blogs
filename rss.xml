&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning is about inferencing values from data. Studying about machine learning, therefore, comes out best by
experimenting with real-world data, not artificial datasets. Fortunately, there are thousands of open datasets to
choose from, ranging across all sorts of domains. Here are a few places we can look at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Approximation Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of studying Approximation Theory is to better understand the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem&quot;&gt;Universal Approximation Theorem&lt;/a&gt;, which defines the
limits (or unbounded potential) of AI and Machine Learning on what Neural Networks can learn to solve real-life
problems. Approximation Theory is the foundation of Machine Learning and its usefulness is brought to life by the
advancement of contemporary computing power. For example, Approximation Theory says an approximated function exists by
Math theorem but does not indicate how to reach that approximation. Artificial Neural Network, trained by Big Data,
reaches that optimal function. Approximation theory is the proof of why AI or Machine Learning works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[K-Armed Bandit Problem: Reinforcement Learning as an Example of Approximation]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following learning problem. We are faced repeatedly with a choice among $k$ different options, or actions.
After each choice we receive a numerical reward chosen from a stationary probability distribution that depends on the
action we selected. Our objective is to maximize the expected total reward over some time period, for example, over
1000 action selections, or &lt;em&gt;time steps&lt;/em&gt;. This is the original form of the &lt;em&gt;$k$-armed bandit problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, each of the $k$ actions has an expected or mean reward given that one action is selected; let us call
this the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of that action. We denote the action selected on time step $t$ as $A_t$ and the corresponding reward as
$R_t$, The value of an arbitrary action $a$, denoted $q_*(a)$, is the expected reward given that $a$ is selected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;q_*(a) = \mathbb{E}[R_t|A_t = a]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we know the value of each action, then it would be trivial to solve the &lt;em&gt;$k$-armed bandit problem&lt;/em&gt;: we would always
select the action with the highest value. We do not know, however, the action values with certainly in reality, although
we may have estimates. We denote the estimated value of action $a$ at time step $t$ as $Q_t(a)$. We would like $Q_t(a)$
to be close to $q_*(a)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we maintain estimates of the action values, then at any time step there is at least one action whose estimated value
is greatest. We call these the &lt;em&gt;greedy&lt;/em&gt; actions. When we select one of these actions, we say that we are &lt;em&gt;exploiting&lt;/em&gt;
our current knowledge of the values of the actions. If instead we select one of the non-greedy actions, then we say we
are &lt;em&gt;exploring&lt;/em&gt;, because this enables us to improve our estimate of the non-greedy action&apos;s value. Exploitation is the
right thing to do to maximize the expected reward on the one step, but exploration may produce the greater total reward
in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that exploring and exploiting is not possible in any single action, systematic methods are used to balance the
exploration and exploitation. This is the basic idea behind reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defining Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt; addresses the question of how to build computer programs that improve their performance at some
task through experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Definition of Learning]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A computer program is said to &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; from experience/data $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance
measure $P$, it its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of &lt;a href=&quot;#approximation-theory&quot;&gt;inducing general functions from specific training examples&lt;/a&gt; is central to
learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Machine Learning v.s. Data Mining]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning and Data Mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning
focuses on prediction, based on &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; properties learned from the training data, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/QubitPi/data-mining&quot;&gt;data mining&lt;/a&gt; focuses on the
discovery of (previously) &lt;em&gt;unknown&lt;/em&gt; properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in
databases)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many different types of machine learning systems that it is useful to classify them in broad categories,
based on the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How they are supervised during training (&lt;a href=&quot;#supervised-unsupervised-semi-supervised-self-supervised-reinforcement-learning&quot;&gt;supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised&lt;/a&gt;, and others)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (&lt;a href=&quot;#online-vs-batch-learning&quot;&gt;online v.s. batch learning&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the
training data and building a predictive model, much like scientists do (
&lt;a href=&quot;#instance-based-vs-model-based-learning&quot;&gt;instance-based v.s. model-based learning&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-Supervised, Self-Supervised, Reinforcement Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning systems can be classified according to the amount and type of supervision they get during training. The
main categories are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supervised learning&lt;/strong&gt;: the training set we feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called &lt;strong&gt;labels&lt;/strong&gt;.
A typical supervised learning task is &lt;em&gt;classification&lt;/em&gt;, such as spam detector in email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised learning&lt;/strong&gt;: the training data is unlabeled. &lt;em&gt;Clustering and 2D/3D Visualization&lt;/em&gt; are examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-supervised learning&lt;/strong&gt;: when labeling data is time-consuming and we end up having some labeled instances and
some unlabeled, simi-supervised learning can deal with this situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-supervised learning&lt;/strong&gt;: generate a fully labeled dataset from a fully unlabeled one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinforcement learning&lt;/strong&gt;: the learning system, called an &lt;strong&gt;agent&lt;/strong&gt; in this context, can observe the environment,
select and perform actions, and get &lt;em&gt;rewards&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;penalties&lt;/em&gt; in return. It must then learn by itself what is the best
strategy, called a &lt;strong&gt;policy&lt;/strong&gt;, to get the most reward over time. A policy defines what action the agent should choose
when it is in a given situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Online v.s. Batch Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Batch learning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In batch learning, the system is trained using all the available data. This will generally take a lot of time and
computing resources, so it is typically done offline. First the system is trained, and then it is launched into
production and runs without learning anymore; it just applies what it has learned. This is called &lt;em&gt;offline learning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The batch learning can be automated fairly easily when it needs a new round of training with new data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/batch-learning.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::kokomi[Practical Batch Learning]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated batch learning is simple and often works fine, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;training using the full set of data can take many hours, so we would typically train a new system only every 24 hours
or even just weekly. If our system needs to adapt to rapidly changing data (e.g., to predict stock prices), then we
need a more reactive solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;training on the full set of data requires a lot of computing resources (CPU, memory space, disk space, disk I/O,
network I/O, etc.). If we have a lot of data and we automate your system to train from scratch every day, it will end
up costing us a lot of money. If the amount of data is huge, it may even be impossible to use a batch learning
algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if our system needs to be able to learn autonomously and it has limited resources (e.g., a smartphone application or a
rover on Mars), then carrying around large amounts of training data and taking up a lot of resources to train for
hours every day is a showstopper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A model&apos;s performance tends to decay slowly over time, simply because the world continues to evolve while the model
remains unchanged. This phenomenon is often called &lt;strong&gt;model rot&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;data drift&lt;/strong&gt; ⚠️. The solution is to regularly
retrain the model on up-to-date data. How often we need to do that depends on the use case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Online Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In online learning, we train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or
in small groups called mini-batches. Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn about new data on
the fly, as it arrives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/online-learning.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important parameter of online learning systems is how fast they should adapt to changing data: this is called the
&lt;strong&gt;learning rate&lt;/strong&gt; (not to be confused with &lt;em&gt;learning rate&lt;/em&gt; as a hyperparameter). If we set a high learning rate, then
our system will rapidly adapt to new data, but it will also tend to quickly forget the old data (for example, a spam
filter would then flag only the latest kinds of spam). Conversely, if we set a low learning rate, the system will have
more inertia; that is, it will learn more slowly, but it will also be less sensitive to noise in the new data or to
sequences of nonrepresentative data points (outliers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::kokomi[Practical Online Learning]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big challenge with online learning is that if bad data is fed to the system, the system&apos;s performance will decline,
possibly quickly. To reduce this risk, we need to monitor our system closely and promptly switch learning off (and
possibly revert to a previously working state) if we detect a drop in performance. We may also want to monitor the input
data and react to abnormal data; for example, using an anomaly detection algorithm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Instance-Based v.s. Model-Based Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more way to categorize machine learning systems is by how they &lt;em&gt;generalize&lt;/em&gt;. Most machine learning tasks are about
making predictions. This means that given a number of training examples, the system needs to be able to make good
predictions for (generalize to) examples it has never seen before. Having a good performance measure on the training
data is good, but insufficient; the true goal is to perform well on new instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 main approaches to generalization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#instance-based-learning&quot;&gt;instance-based learning&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#model-based-learning&quot;&gt;model-based learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Instance-Based Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most trivial form of learning is simply to learn by heart. A spam email detection would measure the
similarity between two emails. A (very basic) similarity measure between two emails could be to count the number of
words they have in common. The system would flag an email as spam if it has many words in common with a known spam
email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called &lt;em&gt;instance-based learning&lt;/em&gt;: the system learns the examples by heart, then generalizes to new cases by
using a similarity measure to compare them to the learned examples (or a subset of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Model-Based Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to generalize from a set of examples is to build a model of these examples and then use that model to make
&lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt;. This is called &lt;em&gt;model-based learning&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/github/QubitPi/machine-learning/blob/master/01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb&quot; class=&quot;google-colab-link&quot; style=&quot;color: white; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 5px 0 1px&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;Explore in Colab&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kaggle.com/kernels/welcome?src=https://github.com/QubitPi/machine-learning/blob/master/01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb&quot; class=&quot;kaggle-link&quot; style=&quot;color: white; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 1px 0 5px&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;Explore in Kaggle&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Main Challenges of Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insufficient Quantity of Training Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of data for most machine learning algorithms to work properly. Even for very simple problems we typically
need thousands of examples, and for complex problems such as image or speech recognition we may need millions of
examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::kokomi[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3115/1073012.1073017&quot;&gt;famous paper&lt;/a&gt; published in 2001, Microsoft researchers Michele
Banko and Eric Brill showed that very different machine learning algorithms, including fairly simple ones, performed
almost identically well on a complex problem of natural language disambiguation once they were given enough data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors put it, &quot;these results suggest that we may want to reconsider the trade-off between spending time and
money on algorithm development versus spending it on corpus development&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that data matters more than algorithms for complex problems was further popularized by Peter Norvig et al. in a
paper titled
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35179.pdf&quot;&gt;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data&lt;/a&gt;&quot;,
published in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nonrepresentative Training Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/github/QubitPi/machine-learning/blob/master/01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb&quot; class=&quot;google-colab-link&quot; style=&quot;color: white; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 5px 0 1px&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;Explore in Colab&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kaggle.com/kernels/welcome?src=https://github.com/QubitPi/machine-learning/blob/master/01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb&quot; class=&quot;kaggle-link&quot; style=&quot;color: white; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 1px 0 5px&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;Explore in Kaggle&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to generalize well, it is crucial that our training data be representative of the new cases we want to
generalize to. This is true whether we use instance-based learning or model-based learning and is often harder than it
sounds: if the sample is too small, we will have &lt;strong&gt;sampling noise&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., non-representative data as a result of
chance), but even very large samples can be non-representative if the sampling method is flawed. This is called
&lt;strong&gt;sampling bias&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overfitting the Training Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/github/QubitPi/machine-learning/blob/master/01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb&quot; class=&quot;google-colab-link&quot; style=&quot;color: white; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 5px 0 1px&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;Explore in Colab&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kaggle.com/kernels/welcome?src=https://github.com/QubitPi/machine-learning/blob/master/01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb&quot; class=&quot;kaggle-link&quot; style=&quot;color: white; text-decoration: none; margin: 0 1px 0 5px&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;Explore in Kaggle&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we are visiting a foreign country and the taxi driver rips us off. We might be tempted to say that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; taxi
drivers in that country are thieves. Overgeneralizing is something that we humans do all too often, and unfortunately
machines can fall into the same trap if we are not careful. In machine learning this is called &lt;strong&gt;overfitting&lt;/strong&gt;: it means
that the model performs well on the training data, but it does not generalize well. See an accompanying Jupyter notebook
example that illustrate such phenomenon and its possible solutions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Underfitting the Training Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underfitting is the opposite of overfitting: it occurs when our model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of
the data. For example, a linear model of life satisfaction is prone to underfit; reality is just more complex than the
model, so its predictions are bound to be inaccurate, even on the training examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the main options for fixing this problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select a more powerful model, with more parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feed better features to the learning algorithm (&lt;strong&gt;Feature Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the constraints on the model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing and Validating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to know how well a model will generalize to new cases is to actually try it out on new cases. One way to do
that is to split our data into two sets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;1️⃣ training set&lt;/strong&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;2️⃣ test set&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these names imply, we train our model using the training set, and we test it using the test set. The error rate on
new cases is called the &lt;strong&gt;generalization error&lt;/strong&gt; (or out-of-sample error), and by evaluating the model on the test set,
we get an estimate of this error. This value tells us how well the model will perform on instances it has never seen
before. If the training error is low but the generalization error is high, it means that the model is overfitting the
training data for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common to use 80% of the data for training and hold out 20% for testing. However, this depends on the size of the
dataset: if it contains 10 million instances, then holding out 1% means the test set will contain 100,000 instances,
probably more than enough to get a good estimate of the generalization error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another situation, suppose we are hesitating between 2 candidate models. How do we decide between them? One option is
to train both and compare how well they generalize using the test set. Suppose further that the linear model generalizes
better, but we want to apply some regularization to avoid overfitting. The question is, how do we choose the value of
the regularization hyperparameter? One option is to train 100 different models using 100 different values for this
hyperparameter. Finally we launch the model with the best hyperparameter value which produces the smallest
generalization error of 5% into production, but unfortunately it does not perform as well as expected and produces 15%
errors. What just happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we measured the generalization error multiple times on the test set, and we adapted the model and
hyperparameters to produce the best model for that particular set. This means the model is unlikely to perform as well
on new data. A common solution to this problem is called &lt;strong&gt;holdout validation&lt;/strong&gt;:  simply hold out part of the training
set to evaluate several candidate models and select the best one. The new held-out set is called the &lt;strong&gt;3️⃣ validation
set&lt;/strong&gt; (or the development set, or dev set). The steps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;train multiple models with various hyperparameters on the reduced training set (i.e., the full training set minus the
validation set)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select the model that performs best on the validation set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;train the best model on the full training set (including the validation set), which gives us the final model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;evaluate this final model on the test set to get an estimate of the generalization error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Machine Learning Project Checklist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a well-organized data scientist, the first thing we should do before any serious business project is to pull out our
machine learning project checklist which can guide us through our machine learning projects in 8 main steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area of Neural Networks has originally been primarily inspired by the goal of modeling biological neural systems,
but has since diverged and become a matter of engineering and achieving good results in Machine Learning tasks.
Therefore, the Neural Networks and AI in general is essentially the discipline of Machine Learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Biological Motivation and Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, digital computers such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_model&quot;&gt;von Neumann model&lt;/a&gt; operate
via the execution of explicit instructions with access to memory by a number of processors. Some neural networks, on the
other hand, originated from efforts to model information processing in biological systems through the framework of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism&quot;&gt;connectionism&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the von Neumann model, connectionist computing does
not separate memory and processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Basic Principles of Connectionism]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central connectionist principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and
often uniform units. The form of the connections and the units can vary from model to model. For example, units in the
network could represent neurons and the connections could represent synapses, as in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activation function&lt;/strong&gt;: Internal states of any network change over time due to neurons sending a signal to a
succeeding layer of neurons in the case of a feedforward network, or to a previous layer in the case of a recurrent
network. &lt;em&gt;The activation function defines under what circumstances will a neuron send a signal outward to other
neurons&lt;/em&gt;. This can be, for example, a function of probability whose range describes the probability of the neuron
firing the signal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory and learning&lt;/strong&gt;: Neural networks follow two basic principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any mental state can be described as a $n$-dimensional vector of numeric activation values over neural units in a
network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory and learning are created by modifying the &apos;weights&apos; of the connections between neural units, generally
represented as an $(n \times m)$ matrix. The weights are adjusted according to some learning rule or algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic computational unit of the brain is a &lt;strong&gt;neuron&lt;/strong&gt;. Approximately 86 billion neurons can be found in the human
nervous system and they are connected with approximately $10^{14}$ - $10^{15}$ synapses. The diagram below shows a
cartoon drawing of a biological neuron (left) and a common mathematical model (right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/neuron-model.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each neuron receives input signals from its &lt;strong&gt;dendrites&lt;/strong&gt; and produces output signals along its (single) &lt;strong&gt;axon&lt;/strong&gt;. The
axon eventually branches out and connects via synapses to dendrites of other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the computational model of a neuron, the signals that travel along the axons (e.g. $x_0$) interact multiplicatively
(e.g. $w_0x_0$) with the dendrites of the other neuron based on the synaptic strength at that synapse (e.g. $w_0$). The
idea is that the synaptic strengths (the weights $w$) are learnable and control the strength of influence (and its
direction: excitory (&lt;strong&gt;positive weight&lt;/strong&gt;) or inhibitory (&lt;strong&gt;negative weight&lt;/strong&gt;)) of one neuron on another. In the basic
model, the dendrites carry the signal to the cell body where they all get summed. If the final sum is above a certain
threshold, the neuron can fire, sending a spike along its axon. In the computational model, we assume that the precise
timings of the spikes do not matter, and that only the frequency of the firing communicates information. Based on this
rate code interpretation, we model the firing rate of the neuron with an &lt;strong&gt;activation function $f$&lt;/strong&gt;, which represents
the frequency of the spikes along the axon. Historically, a common choice of activation function is the sigmoid
function $σ$, since it takes a real-valued input (the signal strength after the sum) and squashes it to range between 0
and 1. An example code for forward-propagating a single neuron might look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Neuron(object):
    # ... 
    def forward(self, inputs):
        &quot;&quot;&quot; assume inputs and weights are 1-D numpy arrays and bias is a number &quot;&quot;&quot;
        cell_body_sum = np.sum(inputs * self.weights) + self.bias
        firing_rate = 1.0 / (1.0 + math.exp(-cell_body_sum)) # sigmoid activation function
        return firing_rate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, each neuron performs a dot product with the input and its weights, adds the bias and applies the
non-linearity (or activation function), in this case the sigmoid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::warning[Coarse model]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important to stress that this model of a biological neuron is very coarse. For example, there are many different
types of neurons, each with different properties. The dendrites in biological neurons perform complex nonlinear
computations. The synapses are not just a single weight, they are a complex non-linear dynamical system. The exact
timing of the output spikes in many systems is known to be important, suggesting that the rate code approximation may
not hold. Due to all these and many other simplifications, be prepared to hear groaning sounds from anyone with some
neuroscience background if we draw analogies between Neural Networks and real brains. See this
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959438814000130&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; if people are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural Networks are modeled as collections of neurons that are connected in an acyclic graph. In other words, the
outputs of some neurons can become inputs to other neurons. Cycles are not allowed since that would imply an infinite
loop in the forward pass of a network. Instead of an amorphous blobs of connected neurons, Neural Network models are
often organized into distinct layers of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (&lt;strong&gt;ConvNets&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;CNNs&lt;/strong&gt;) are a category of Neural Networks that have proven very
effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. ConvNets have been successful in identifying faces,
objects and traffic signs apart from powering vision in robots and self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/cnn-example-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the figure above, a ConvNet is able to recognize scenes and the system is able to suggest relevant captions (&quot;a
soccer player is kicking a soccer ball&quot;) while figure below shows an example of ConvNets being used for recognizing
everyday objects, humans and animals. Lately,
&lt;a href=&quot;#convolutional-neural-networks-for-nlp&quot;&gt;ConvNets have been effective in several Natural Language Processing tasks&lt;/a&gt;
(such as sentence classification) as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/cnn-example-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, every image can be represented as a matrix of pixel values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/image-matrix.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(digital_image)&quot;&gt;Channel&lt;/a&gt; is a conventional term used to refer to a certain
component of an image. An image from a standard digital camera will have three channels - red, green and blue - we can
imagine those as three 2d-matrices stacked over each other (one for each color), each having pixel values in the range 0
to 255. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale&quot;&gt;grayscale&lt;/a&gt; image, on the other hand, has just one channel. We will
only consider grayscale images, so we will have a single 2d matrix representing an image. The value of each pixel in the
matrix will range from 0 to 255 - zero indicating black and 255 indicating white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Convolution Step&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConvNets derive their name from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution&quot;&gt;&quot;convolution&quot; operator&lt;/a&gt;. The primary
purpose of convolution in case of a ConvNet is to extract features from the input image. Convolution preserves the
spatial relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data. We will not go into
the mathematical details of Convolution here, but will try to understand how it works over images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed above, every image can be considered as a matrix of pixel values. Consider a 5 x 5 image whose pixel
values are only 0 and 1 (note that for a grayscale image, pixel values range from 0 to 255, the green matrix below is a
special case where pixel values are only 0 and 1):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/5by5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, consider another 3 x 3 matrix as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/3by3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the Convolution of the 5 x 5 image and the 3 x 3 matrix can be computed as shown in the animation below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/convolution.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We slide the orange matrix over our original image (green) by 1 pixel (also called &lt;strong&gt;stride&lt;/strong&gt;) and for every position,
we compute element wise multiplication (between the two matrices) and add the multiplication outputs to get the final
integer which forms a single element of the output matrix (pink). Note that the 3×3 matrix sees only a part of the input
image in each stride. In CNN terminology, the 3×3 matrix is called a &lt;strong&gt;filter&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kernel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;feature detector&lt;/strong&gt;
and the matrix formed by sliding the filter over the image and computing the dot product is called the &lt;strong&gt;Convolved
Feature&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Activation Map&lt;/strong&gt; or the &lt;strong&gt;Feature Map&lt;/strong&gt;. It is important to note that filters acts as feature detectors
from the original input image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, a CNN learns the values of these filters on its own during the training process (although we still need to specify parameters such as number of filters, filter size, architecture of the network etc. before the training process). The more filters we have, the more image features get extracted and the better our network becomes at recognizing patterns in unseen images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the Feature Map is controlled by 3 parameters that we need to decide before the convolution step is
performed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depth&lt;/strong&gt;: Depth corresponds to the number of filters we use for the convolution operation. In the network shown
below, we are performing convolution of the original boat image using three distinct filters, thus producing three
different feature maps as shown. We can think of these three feature maps as stacked 2d matrices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/depth.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stride&lt;/strong&gt;: Stride is the number of pixels by which we slide our filter matrix over the input matrix. When the stride
is 1 then we move the filters one pixel at a time. When the stride is 2, then the filters jump 2 pixels at a time as
we slide them around. Having a larger stride will produce smaller feature maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero-padding&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes, it is convenient to pad the input matrix with zeros around the border, so that we can
apply the filter to bordering elements of our input image matrix. A nice feature of zero padding is that it allows us
to control the size of the feature maps. Adding zero-padding is also called &lt;em&gt;wide convolution&lt;/em&gt;, and not using
zero-padding would be a &lt;em&gt;narrow convolution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pooling Step&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spatial Pooling (also called subsampling or downsampling) reduces the dimensionality of each feature map but retains the
most important information. Spatial Pooling can be of different types: Max, Average, Sum etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of Max Pooling, we define a spatial neighborhood (for example, a 2×2 window) and take the largest element from
the rectified feature map within that window. Instead of taking the largest element we could also take the average
(Average Pooling) or sum of all elements in that window. In practice, Max Pooling has been shown to work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/pooling.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pooling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;makes the input representations (feature dimension) smaller and more manageable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduces the number of parameters and computations in the network, therefore, controlling overfitting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;makes the network invariant to small transformations, distortions and translations in the input image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps us arrive at an almost scale invariant representation of our image. This is very powerful since we can detect
objects in an image no matter where they are located&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A convolutional neural network consists of an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer. In a convolutional neural
network, &lt;strong&gt;the hidden layers include one or more layers that perform &lt;a href=&quot;#convolution-step&quot;&gt;convolutions&lt;/a&gt; followed by other
layers such as &lt;a href=&quot;#pooling-step&quot;&gt;pooling&lt;/a&gt; layers and fully connected layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several convolutional and max pooling layers, the final classification is done via fully connected layers. Neurons
in a fully connected layer have connections to neurons in the previous layer. The input to this fully connected layer
is a one-dimensional vector, which is the flattened output of the convolutional/pooling layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::kokomi[What does the flattening look like?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the input to the fully connected network (FCN) is the output of the final
convolutional layer or pooling layer. This input is typically a 3-dimensional tensor with height, width, and depth
representing the extracted features. The flattening on this 3D tensor is essentially &quot;unfolding&quot; all the dimensions
together. The resulting one-dimensional vector will have a size equal to the product of the original dimensions. For
example, a $5 \times 5 \times 2$ tensor has the flattened vector with size of $5 \times 5 \times 2 = 50$, which is the
number of neurons of the FCN input layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/cnn-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two aspects of this computation worth paying attention to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location Invariance&lt;/strong&gt;: Let&apos;s say we want to classify whether or not there&apos;s an elephant in an image. Because we are
sliding our filters over the whole image we don&apos;t really care where the elephant occurs. In practice,
&lt;a href=&quot;#pooling-step&quot;&gt;pooling&lt;/a&gt; also gives us invariance to translation, rotation and scaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compositionality&lt;/strong&gt;: Each filter composes a local patch of lower-level features into higher-level representation.
That&apos;s why CNNs are so powerful in Computer Vision. It makes intuitive sense that you build edges from pixels, shapes
from edges, and more complex objects from shapes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks for NLP&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of image pixels, the input to most NLP tasks are sentences or documents represented as a matrix. Each row of the
matrix corresponds to one token, typically a word, but it could be a character. That is, each row is vector that
represents a word. Typically, these vectors are word embeddings (low-dimensional representations) like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec&quot;&gt;word2vec&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/&quot;&gt;GloVe&lt;/a&gt;, but they could
also be one-hot vectors that index the word into a vocabulary. For a 10 word sentence using a 100-dimensional embedding
we would have a 10×100 matrix as our input. That&apos;s our &quot;image&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vision, our filters slide over local patches of an image, but in NLP we typically use filters that slide over full
rows of the matrix (words). Thus, the &quot;width&quot; of our filters is usually the same as the width of the input matrix. The
height, or &lt;strong&gt;region size&lt;/strong&gt;, may vary, but sliding windows over 2-5 words at a time is typical. Putting all the above
together, a Convolutional Neural Network for NLP may look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nlp-cnn.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the illustration of this Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for sentence classification above, we depict
three filter region sizes: 2, 3 and 4, each of which has 2 filters. Every filter performs convolution on the sentence
matrix and generates (variable-length) feature maps. Then 1-max pooling is performed over each map, i.e., the largest
number from each feature map is recorded. Thus a univariate feature vector is generated from all six maps, and these 6
features are concatenated to form a feature vector for the penultimate layer. The final softmax layer then receives this
feature vector as input and uses it to classify the sentence; here we assume binary classification and hence depict two
possible output states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the nice intuitions we had for Computer Vision? Location Invariance and local Compositionality made intuitive
sense for images, but not so much for NLP. We probably do care a lot where in the sentence a word appears (Except for
Latin). Pixels close to each other are likely to be semantically related (part of the same object), but the same isn&apos;t
always true for words. In many languages, parts of phrases could be separated by several other words. The compositional
aspect isn&apos;t obvious either. Clearly, words compose in some ways, like an adjective modifying a noun, but how exactly
this works what higher level representations actually &quot;mean&quot; isn’t as obvious as in the Computer Vision case. Given all
this, &lt;a href=&quot;#recurrent-neural-networks-rnns&quot;&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks&lt;/a&gt; make more intuitive sense. They resemble how we
process language, or at least how we think we process language: Reading sequentially from left to right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A glaring limitation of Vanilla Neural Networks (and also &lt;a href=&quot;#convolutional-neural-networks-cnns&quot;&gt;Convolutional Networks&lt;/a&gt;)
is that their API is too constrained. They accept a fixed-sized vector as input (e.g. an image) and produce a
fixed-sized vector as output (e.g. probabilities of different classes). In addition, these models perform this mapping
using a fixed amount of computational steps (e.g. the number of layers in the model). The core reason that recurrent
nets are more exciting is that they allow us to operate over sequences of vectors: Sequences in the input, the output,
or in the most general case both. We will illustrate this now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all heard of this buz word &quot;LLM&quot; (Large Language Model). But let&apos;s put that aside for just a second and look at a
much simpler one called &quot;character-level language model&quot; where, for example, we input a prefix of a word such as &quot;hell&quot;
and the model outputs a complete word &quot;hello&quot;. We call inputs like &quot;hell&quot; a &lt;strong&gt;sequence&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we train such model? One approach is to have &lt;strong&gt;one function invoked 4 times&lt;/strong&gt;, with each time taking a single
character as input and calculates an output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/rnn-4-black-boxes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Input for the function is actually a one-hot encoded vector representing a single character]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &quot;hello&quot; example above, the input sequence would be &quot;h&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;o&quot;. For each of these characters, the
input to the function is not the character itself, but a vector. This vector has a size equal to the total number of
unique characters in our vocabulary, i.e. a vocabulary of four possible letters &quot;helo&quot;. For a specific character, the
vector will have a value of 1 at the index corresponding to that character, and 0 everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the input for the character &quot;h&quot; would be a vector of length 4. This vector would have a value of 1 at the
1st position (since &apos;h&apos; is the 1st letter of the alphabet) and 0s in all other 3 positions. The next input would be the
one-hot encoded vector for &quot;e&quot;, and so on. This process allows the function to handle sequential data by processing one
character at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one might have noticed that if the 3rd invocation produces $f(&apos;l&apos;) = &apos;l&apos;$, then why would the 4th one, given the
same input, outputs a different character of &apos;o&apos;? This suggests that we should take the &lt;strong&gt;history&lt;/strong&gt; into
account. Instead of having $f$ depend on 1 parameter, we now have it take 2 parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a character, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a variable that summarizes the previous calculations:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/rnn-4-black-boxes-connected.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it makes much more sense with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
f(\text{‘l&apos;}, h_2) = \text{‘l&apos;}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
f(\text{‘l&apos;}, h_3) = \text{‘o&apos;}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we want to predict a longer or shorter word? For example, how about predicting &quot;cat&quot; by &quot;ca&quot;? That&apos;s simple,
we will have 2 black boxes to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/rnn-multi-sequences.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the function $f$ is not smart enough to produce the correct output everytime? We will simply collect a lot of
examples such as &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;hello&quot;, and feed them into the boxes to train them until they can output correct vocabulary
like &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;hello&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the idea behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network&quot;&gt;RNN&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s recurrent because the boxed
function gets invoked &lt;strong&gt;repeatedly&lt;/strong&gt; for each element of the sequence. In the case of our character-level language model,
element is a character such as &quot;e&quot; and sequence is a string like &quot;hell&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram below is not multiple functions chained together, but a single function being &lt;strong&gt;repeatedly&lt;/strong&gt; invoked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/rnn.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each function $f$ is a network unit containing 2 perceptrons. One perceptron computes the &quot;history&quot; like $h_1$, $h_2$,
$h_3$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One great thing about the RNNs is that they offer a lot of flexibility on how we wire up the neural network
architecture. Normally when we are working with neural networks, we are given a fixed sized input vector (red boxes
below), then we process it with some hidden layers (green), and we produce a fixed sized output vector (blue). The
left-most model in figure below is the &lt;a href=&quot;#architecture&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanilla Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which receives a single input and
produce one output (&lt;em&gt;The green box in between actually represents &lt;strong&gt;layers&lt;/strong&gt; of neurons&lt;/em&gt;). The rest of the models on the
right are all &lt;strong&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt; that allow us to operate over sequences of input, output, or both at the
same time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example of &lt;strong&gt;one-to-many&lt;/strong&gt; model is image captioning where we are given a fixed sized image and produce a sequence
of words that describe the content of that image through RNN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example of &lt;strong&gt;many-to-one&lt;/strong&gt; task is sentiment classification in NLP where we are given a sequence of words of a&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sentence and then classify what sentiment (e.g. positive or negative) that sentence is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example of &lt;strong&gt;many-to-many&lt;/strong&gt; task is machine translation in NLP, where we can have an RNN that takes a sequence of
words of a sentence in English, and then this RNN is asked to produce a sequence of words of a sentence in German.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is also a &lt;strong&gt;variation of many-to-many&lt;/strong&gt; task as shown in the last model in figure below, where the model
generates an output at every timestep. An example of this many-to-many task is video classification on a frame level
where the model classifies every single frame of video with some number of classes. We should note that we don&apos;t want
this prediction to only be a function of the current timestep (current frame of the video), but also all the timesteps
(frames) that have come before this video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/types.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;#convolutional-neural-networks-cnns&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; learns to recognize patterns across &lt;strong&gt;space&lt;/strong&gt;. So a CNN will learn to
recognize components of an image (e.g., lines, curves, etc.) and then learn to combine these components to recognize
larger structures (e.g., faces, objects, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A RNN will similarly learn to recognize patterns across &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;. So a RNN that is trained to translate text might learn
that &quot;dog&quot; should be translated differently if preceded by the word &quot;hot&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism by which the two kinds of NNs represent these patterns is different, however. In the case of a CNN, we are
looking for the same patterns on all the different subfields of the image. In the case of a RNN we are (in the simplest
case) feeding the hidden layers from the previous step as an additional input into the next step. While the RNN builds
up memory in this process, it is not looking for the same patterns over different slices of time in the same way that a
CNN is looking for the same patterns over different regions of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that &quot;time&quot; and &quot;space&quot; here shouldn&apos;t be taken too literally. We could run a RNN on a single image
for image captioning, for instance, and the meaning of &quot;time&quot; would simply be the order in which different parts of the
image are processed. So objects initially processed will inform the captioning of later objects processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence regime of operation is much more powerful compared to fixed networks that are doomed from the get-go by a
fixed number of computational steps. Moreover, as we’ll see in a bit, RNNs combine the input vector with their state
vector with a fixed (but learned) function to produce a new state vector. This can in programming terms be interpreted
as running a fixed program with certain inputs and some internal variables. Viewed this way, RNNs essentially describe
programs. In fact, it is known that &lt;a href=&quot;http://binds.cs.umass.edu/papers/1995_Siegelmann_Science.pdf&quot;&gt;RNNs are Turing-Complete&lt;/a&gt;
in the sense that they can simulate arbitrary programs (with proper weights).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::kokomi[Space → Time v.s. Function → Program]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If training &lt;a href=&quot;#convolutional-neural-networks-cnns&quot;&gt;vanilla neural nets&lt;/a&gt; is optimization over functions, training
recurrent nets is optimization over programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our data is not in form of sequences, we can still formulate and train powerful models that learn to process it
sequentially. We&apos;re learning stateful programs that process our fixed-sized data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core, RNNs accept an input vector &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and give us an output vector &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. This output vector&apos;s contents are
influenced not only by the input we just fed in, but also on the entire history of inputs we&apos;ve fed in from the past.
The RNN&apos;s API consists of a single step function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rnn = RNN()
y = rnn.step(x) # x is an input vector, y is the RNN&apos;s output vector
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where RNN starts to model the notion of &quot;memory&quot;: The RNN class has some internal state that is updated
every time &lt;code&gt;step()&lt;/code&gt; is called. In the simplest case this state consists of a single hidden vector &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class RNN:
    # ...
    def step(self, x):
        # update the hidden state
        self.h = np.tanh(np.dot(self.W_hh, self.h) + np.dot(self.W_xh, x))
        # compute the output vector
        y = np.dot(self.W_hy, self.h)
        return y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The step function above specifies the forward pass of RNN. There are 3 parameters $W_hh$, $W_xh$, and $W_hy$. The hidden
vector, or more generally the hidden state, is defined by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
h^{(t)} = g_1\left( W_{hh}h^{(t - 1)} + W_{xh}x^{(t)} + b_h \right)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $t$ is the index of the &quot;black boxes&quot; shown earlier. In our example of &quot;hell&quot;, $t \in { 1, 2, 3, 4 }$. The
hidden state $h$ is usually initialized with zero vector (simulating &quot;no memory at all&quot;). There are 2 terms inside the
$g_1$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one term based on the previous hidden state $W_{hh}h^{(t - 1)}$, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the other term based on the current input $W_{xh}x^{(t)}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the program above we use numpy &lt;code&gt;np.dot&lt;/code&gt; which is a matrix multiplication. The 2 terms interact with addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We initialize matrices $W_hh$, $W_xh$, and $W_hy$ with random numbers and the bulk of work during training goes into
finding the matrices that gives rise to the desirable behavior, as measured with some &lt;a href=&quot;#loss-function-of-rnn&quot;&gt;loss function&lt;/a&gt;
that expresses our preferences to what kind of output &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; we would like to see in response to our input sequence &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value $y$ is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
o^{(t)} = g_2\left( W_{yh}h^{(t)} + b_o \right)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[What are $g_1$ and $g_2$?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are &lt;strong&gt;activation functions&lt;/strong&gt; which are used to change the linear function in a perceptron to a non-linear function.
Please refer to &lt;em&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/em&gt; by Mitchell, Tom M. (1997), Paperback (page 96) for why we bump it to non-linear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical activation function for $g_1$ is $tanh$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which squashes the activations to the range $[0, 1]$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, $g_2$ is constance, i.e. $g_2 = 1$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get RNNs as neural networks if we stack up as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;y1 = rnn1.step(x)
y = rnn2.step(y1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words we have two separate RNNs: One RNN is receiving the input vectors and the second RNN is receiving the
output of the first RNN as its input. Except neither of these RNNs know or care - it’s all just vectors coming in and
going out, and some gradients flowing through each module during backpropagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forward Propagation Equations for RNN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now develop the forward propagation equations for the RNN. We assume the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
i.e. $tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}$ and that the output is discrete, as if the RNN is used to predict
words or characters. A natural way to represent discrete variables is to regard the output $\boldsymbol{o}$ as giving
the unnormalized log probabilities of each possible value of the discrete variable. We can then apply the softmax
(discussed shortly) operation as a post-processing step to obtain a vector $\boldsymbol{\hat{y}^{(t)}}$ of normalized
probabilities over the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward propagation begins with a specification of the initial state $\boldsymbol{h}^{(0)}$. The dimension of the hidden
state $\boldsymbol{h}$, in contract to our &lt;a href=&quot;#introduction&quot;&gt;previous overview&lt;/a&gt;, is independent of the dimension of the
input or output sequences. In fact, $\boldsymbol{h}$ is a 3D array, whose 1st-dimensional size is exactly the number of
RNN parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, for each time step from $t = 1$ to $t = \tau$, we apply the following update equations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\color{green} \boxed{
\begin{gather*}
\boldsymbol{h}^{(t)} = \tanh\left( \boldsymbol{W_{hh}}h^{(t - 1)} + \boldsymbol{W_{xh}}x^{(t)} + \boldsymbol{b_h} \right) \ \
\boldsymbol{o}^{(t)} = \boldsymbol{W_{yh}}\boldsymbol{h}^{(t)} + \boldsymbol{b_o} \ \
\boldsymbol{\hat{y}^{(t)}} = softmax(\boldsymbol{o}^{(t)})
\end{gather*}
}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\boldsymbol{h}^{(t)}$ is the hidden state vector of size $(\tau + 1)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\boldsymbol{o}^{(t)}$ is the output produced by the model at step $t$ where $t \in {1, 2, \cdots, \tau}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\boldsymbol{\hat{y}^{(t)}}$ is the normalized probability of $\boldsymbol{o}^{(t)}$ at $\tau = t$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\boldsymbol{b_h}$ is the hidden bias vector of size $\tau$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\boldsymbol{b_o}$ is the output bias vector of size $\tau$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the size of $\boldsymbol{W_{xh}}$ is $(\tau - 1) \times \tau$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the size of $\boldsymbol{W_{hh}}$ is $(\tau - 1) \times (\tau - 1)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the size of $\boldsymbol{W_{xh}}$ is $\tau \times (\tau - 1)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this recurrent network maps an input sequence to an output sequence of the same length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Loss Function of RNN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the discussion of &lt;em&gt;Machine Learning by Mitchell&lt;/em&gt;, Tom M. (1997), the key for training RNN or any neural
network is through &quot;specifying a measure for the training error&quot;. We call this measure a &lt;strong&gt;loss function&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In RNN, the total loss for a given sequence of input $\boldsymbol{x}$ paired with a sequence of expected
$\boldsymbol{y}$ is the sum of the losses over all the time steps, i.e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\mathcal{L}\left( { \boldsymbol{x}^{(1)}, ..., \boldsymbol{x}^{(\tau)} }, { \boldsymbol{y}^{(1)}, ..., \boldsymbol{y}^{(\tau)} } \right) = \sum_t^{\tau} \mathcal{L}^{(t)}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the exact form of $\mathcal{L}^{(t)}$ requires our intuitive understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;#cross-entropy&quot;&gt;cross-entropy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cross-Entropy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In information theory, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-entropy&quot;&gt;cross-entropy&lt;/a&gt; between two probability
distributions $p$ and $q$ over the same underlying set of events measures the average number of bits needed to identify
an event drawn from the set if a coding scheme used for the set is optimized for an estimated probability distribution
$q$, rather than the true distribution $p$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confused? Let&apos;s put it in the context of Machine Learning. Machine Learning sees the world based on probability. The
&quot;probability distribution&quot; identifies the various tasks to learn. For example, a daily language such as English or
Chinese, can be seen as a probability distribution. The probability of &quot;name&quot; followed by &quot;is&quot; is far greater than &quot;are&quot;
as in &quot;My name is Jack&quot;. We call such language distribution $p$. The task of RNN (or Machine Learning in general) is to
learn an approximated distribution of $p$; we call this approximation $q$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The average number of bits needed&quot; is can be seen as the distance between $p$ and $q$ given an event. In analogy of
language, this can be the &lt;em&gt;quantitative&lt;/em&gt; measure of the deviation between a real language phrase &quot;My name is Jack&quot; and
&quot;My name are Jack&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, it is easy to imagine that, in the Machine Learning world, the cross entropy indicates the distance
between what the model believes the output distribution should be and what the original distribution really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have an intuitive understanding of cross entropy, let&apos;s formally define it. The cross-entropy of the discrete
probability distribution $q$ relative to a distribution $p$ over a given set is defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
H(p, q) = -\sum_x p(x)\log q(x)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we assume the softmax probability distribution earlier, the probability distribution of $q(x)$ is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\mathcal{L} = -\sum_t p(t)\log\sigma(\boldsymbol{o}^{(t)}) = -\sum_t\log\sigma(\boldsymbol{o}^{(t)}) = -\sum_t^{\tau}\log\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}^{(t)}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\boldsymbol{o}$ is the predicted sequence by RNN and $o_i$ is the &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;-th element of the predicted sequence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the total loss for a given sequence of input $\boldsymbol{x}$ paired with a sequence of expected
$\boldsymbol{y}$ is the sum of the losses over all the time steps, i.e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\color{green} \boxed{
\mathcal{L}\left( { \boldsymbol{x}^{(1)}, ..., \boldsymbol{x}^{(\tau)} }, { \boldsymbol{y}^{(1)}, ..., \boldsymbol{y}^{(\tau)} } \right) = \sum_t^{\tau} \mathcal{L}^{(t)} = -\sum_t^{\tau}\log\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}^{(t)}
}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[What is the Mathematical form of $p(i)$ in RNN? Why would it become 1?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By definition, $p(i)$ is the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; distribution whose exact functional form is unknown. In the language of
Approximation Theory, $p(i)$ is the function that RNN is trying to learn or approximate mathematically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the $p(i)$ makes the exact form of $\mathcal{L}$ unknown, computationally $p(i)$ is perfectly defined in each
training example. Taking our &quot;hello&quot; example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/char-level-language-model.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4 probability distributions of $q(x)$ is &quot;reflected&quot; in the output layer of this example. They are &quot;reflecting&quot; the
probability distribution of $q(x)$ because they are only $o$ values and have not been transformed to the $\sigma$
distribution yet. But in this case, we are 100% sure that the true probability distribution $p(i)$ for the 4 outputs are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{pmatrix}0\1\0\0\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}0\0\1\0\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}0\0\1\0\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}0\0\0\1\end{pmatrix}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;respectively. That is all we need for calculating the $\mathcal{L}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function&quot;&gt;softmax function&lt;/a&gt; takes as input a vector $z$ of $K$ real numbers,
and normalizes it into a probability distribution consisting of $K$ probabilities proportional to the exponentials of
the input numbers. That is, prior to applying softmax, some vector components could be negative, or greater than one;
and might not sum to 1; but after applying softmax, each component will be in the interval $(0, 1)$ and the components
will add up to 1, so that they can be interpreted as probabilities. Furthermore, the larger input components will
correspond to larger probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a vector $z$ of $K$ real numbers, the the standard (unit) softmax function $\sigma: \mathbb{R}^K \mapsto (0, 1)^K$,
where $K \ge 1$ is defined by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\sigma(\boldsymbol{z})&lt;em&gt;i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum&lt;/em&gt;{j = 1}^Ke^{z_j}}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $i = 1, 2, ..., K$ and $\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_K) \in \mathbb{R}^K$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of RNN,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\sigma(\boldsymbol{o})&lt;em&gt;i = -\frac{e^{o_i}}{\sum&lt;/em&gt;{j = 1}^ne^{o_j}}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$n$ is the length of a sequence feed into the RNN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$o_i$ is the output by perceptron unit &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$i = 1, 2, ..., n$,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\boldsymbol{o} = (o_1, o_2, ..., o_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The softmax function takes an N-dimensional vector of arbitrary real values and produces another N-dimensional vector
with real values in the range (0, 1) that add up to 1.0. It maps $\mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\sigma(\boldsymbol{o}): \begin{pmatrix}o_1\o_2\\dots\o_n\end{pmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\dots\\sigma_n\end{pmatrix}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This property of softmax function that it outputs a probability distribution makes it suitable for probabilistic
interpretation in classification tasks. Neural networks, however, are commonly trained under a log loss (or
cross-entropy) regime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to compute the derivative of the softmax function because we will be using it for training our RNN model
shortly. But before diving in, it is important to keep in mind that Softmax is fundamentally a vector function. It takes
a vector as input and produces a vector as output; in other words, it has multiple inputs and multiple outputs.
Therefore, we cannot just ask for &quot;the derivative of softmax&quot;; We should instead specify:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which component (output element) of softmax we&apos;re seeking to find the derivative of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since softmax has multiple inputs, with respect to which input element the partial derivative is computed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we&apos;re looking for is the partial derivatives of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial \sigma_i}{\partial o_k} = \frac{\partial }{\partial o_k} \frac{e^{o_i}}{\sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j}}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\frac{\partial \sigma_i}{\partial o_k}$ is the partial derivative of the i-th output with respect with the k-th
input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll be using the quotient rule of derivatives. For $h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ where both $f$ and $g$ are
differentiable and $g(x) \ne 0$, The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_rule&quot;&gt;quotient rule&lt;/a&gt; states that the
derivative of $h(x)$ is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
h&apos;(x) = \frac{f&apos;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&apos;(x)}{g^2(x)}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
f&apos;(o_k) = \frac{\partial}{\partial o_k} e^{o_i} = \begin{cases}
e^{o_k}, &amp;amp; \text{if}\ i = k \
0,       &amp;amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
g&apos;(o_k) = \frac{\partial}{\partial o_k} \sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j} = \left( \frac{\partial e^{o_1}}{\partial o_k} + \frac{\partial e^{o_2}}{\partial o_k} + \dots + \frac{\partial e^{o_k}}{\partial o_k} + \dots + \frac{\partial e^{o_n}}{\partial o_k} \right) = \frac{\partial e^{o_k}}{\partial o_k} = e^{o_k}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of it becomes trivial then. When $i = k$,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial \sigma_i}{\partial o_k} = \frac{e^{o_k} \sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j} - e^{o_k} e^{o_i}}{\left( \sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j} \right)^2}
= \frac{e^{o_i} \sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j} - e^{o_i} e^{o_i}}{\left( \sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j} \right)^2}
= \frac{e^{o_i}}{\sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j}} \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j} - e^{o_i}}{\sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j}} \
= \sigma_i\left( \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j}}{\sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j}} - \frac{e^{o_i}}{\sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j}} \right)
= \sigma_i \left( 1 - \sigma_i \right)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When $i \ne k$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial \sigma_i}{\partial o_k} = \frac{-e^{o_k} e^{o_i}}{\left( \sum_{j = 1}^ne^{o_j} \right)^2} = -\sigma_i\sigma_k
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes the derivative of the softmax function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$

&lt;h3&gt;Deriving Gradient Descent Weight Update Rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training a RNN model of is the same thing as searching for the optimal values for the following parameters of the
&lt;a href=&quot;#forward-propagation-equations-for-rnn&quot;&gt;Forward Progagation Equations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$W_{xh}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$W_{hh}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$W_{yh}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$b_h$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$b_o$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the Gradient Descent discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/c/bccmQ6jv&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/em&gt; by Mitchell, Tom M. (1997), Paperback&lt;/a&gt;, we should derive the
weight update rule by taking partial derivatives with respect to all of the variables above. Let&apos;s start with $W_{yh}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/c/bccmQ6jv&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/em&gt; by Mitchell, Tom M. (1997), Paperback&lt;/a&gt; has also mentioned gradients and partial derivatives as being
important for an optimization algorithm to update, say, the model weights of a neural network to reach an optimal set of
weights. The use of partial derivatives permits each weight to be updated independently of the others, by calculating
the gradient of the error curve with respect to each weight in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the functions that we usually work with in machine learning are multivariate, vector-valued functions, which
means that they map multiple real inputs $n$ to multiple real outputs $m$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In training a neural network, the backpropagation algorithm is responsible for sharing back the error calculated at the
output layer among the neurons comprising the different hidden layers of the neural network, until it reaches the input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our RNN contains only 1 perceptron unit, the error is propagated back by, using the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule&quot;&gt;Chain Rule&lt;/a&gt; of $\frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dy}\frac{dy}{dx}$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial o}\frac{\partial o}{\partial W}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in the RNN mode, $\mathcal{L}$ is not a direct function of $W$. Thus its first order derivative cannot be
computed unless we connect the $\mathcal{L}$ to $o$ first and then to $W$, because both the first order derivatives of
$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial o}$ and $\frac{\partial o}{\partial W}$ are defined by the model presented earlier
above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is more often the case that we&apos;d have many connected perceptrons populating the network, each attributed a different
weight. Since this is the case for RNN, we can generalise multiple inputs and multiple outputs using the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://machinelearningmastery.com/the-chain-rule-of-calculus-for-univariate-and-multivariate-functions/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generalized Chain Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Generalized Chain Rule]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the case where $x \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $u \in \mathbb{R}^n$; an inner function, $f$, maps $m$ inputs to $n$
outputs, while an outer function, $g$, receives $n$ inputs to produce an output, $h \in \mathbb{R}^k$. For
$i = 1, \dots, m$  the generalized chain rule states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial h}{\partial u_1} \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_i} + \frac{\partial h}{\partial u_2} \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_i} + \dots + \frac{\partial h}{\partial u_n} \frac{\partial u_n}{\partial x_i} = \sum_{j = 1}^n \frac{\partial h}{\partial u_j} \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the error propagation of Gradient Descent in RNN is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\color{green} \boxed{
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{yh}} = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial o_i^{(t)}} \frac{\partial o_i^{(t)}}{\partial W_{yh}} \
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{hh}} = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial h_i^{(t)}} \frac{\partial h_i^{(t)}}{\partial W_{hh}} \
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{xh}} = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial h_i^{(t)}} \frac{\partial h_i^{(t)}}{\partial W_{xh}}
\end{align}
}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $n$ is the length of a RNN sequence and $t$ the index of timestep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note[On $\sum_{t = 1}^\tau$]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assume the error is the sum of all errors of each timestep, which is why we include the $\sum_{t = 1}^\tau$ term&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s look at $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{W_{yh}}$ first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{W_{yh}} = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial o_i^{(t)}} \frac{\partial o_i^{(t)}}{\partial W_{yh}}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since $o_i = \left( W_{yh}h_i + b_o \right)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial o_i}{W_{yh}} = \frac{\partial }{W_{yh}}\left( W_{yh}h_i + b_o \right) = h_i
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial o_i}$ we shall recall from the earlier discussion on softmax derivative
that we CANNOT simply have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial o_i} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial o_i}\sum_i^np(i)\log\sigma_i
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because we need to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specify which component (output element) we&apos;re seeking to find the derivative of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with respect to which input element the partial derivative is computed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial o_i} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial o_i}\sum_j^np(j)\log\sigma_j = -\sum_j^n\frac{\partial}{\partial o_i}p(j)\log\sigma_j = -\sum_j^np(j)\frac{\partial \log\sigma_j}{\partial o_i}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $n$ is the number of timesteps (or the length of a sequence such as &quot;hell&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying the chain rule again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
-\sum_j^np(j)\frac{\partial \log\sigma_j}{\partial o_i} = -\sum_j^np(j)\frac{1}{\sigma_j}\frac{\partial\sigma_j}{\partial o_i}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall we have already derived that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial \sigma_i}{\partial o_j} = \begin{cases}
\sigma_i \left( 1 - \sigma_i \right), &amp;amp; \text{if}\ i = j \
-\sigma_i\sigma_j,                    &amp;amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
-\sum_j^np(j)\frac{1}{\sigma_j}\frac{\partial\sigma_j}{\partial o_i} = -\sum_{i = j}^np(j)\frac{1}{\sigma_j}\frac{\partial\sigma_j}{\partial o_i} -\sum_{i \ne j}^np(j)\frac{1}{\sigma_j}\frac{\partial\sigma_j}{\partial o_i} = -p(i)(1 - \sigma_i) + \sum_{i \ne j}^np(j)\sigma_i
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observing that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\sum_{j}^np(j) = 1
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
-p(i)(1 - \sigma_i) + \sum_{i \ne j}^np(j)\sigma_i = -p(i) + p(i)\sigma_i + \sum_{i \ne j}^np(j)\sigma_i = \sigma_i - p(i)
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\color{green} \boxed{\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial o_i} = \sigma_i - p(i)}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\color{green} \boxed{ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{yh}} = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \sum_i^n\left[ \sigma_i - p(i) \right] h_i = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \left( \boldsymbol{\sigma} - \boldsymbol{p} \right) \boldsymbol{h}^{(t)} }
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b_o} = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \sum_i^n\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial o_i^{(t)}}\frac{\partial o_i^{(t)}}{\partial b_o^{(t)}} = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \sum_i^n\left[ \sigma_i - p(i) \right] \times 1
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\color{green} \boxed{ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b_o} = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \sum_i^n\left[ \sigma_i - p(i) \right] = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \boldsymbol{\sigma} - \boldsymbol{p} }
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have at this point derived backpropagating rule for $W_{yh}$ and $b_o$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$W_{xh}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$W_{hh}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✅ $W_{yh}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$b_h$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✅ $b_o$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&apos;s look at $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{hh}}$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from &lt;em&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/em&gt;, section 6.5.2, p. 207 that the vector notation of
$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x_i} = \sum_j \frac{\partial z}{\partial y_j}\frac{\partial y_j}{\partial x_i}$ is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}}z = \left( \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{y}}{\partial \boldsymbol{x}} \right)^\intercal \nabla_{\boldsymbol{y}}z
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us a start with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{hh}} &amp;amp;= \sum_{t = 1}^\tau \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial h_i^{(t)}} \frac{\partial h_i^{(t)}}{\partial W_{hh}} \

&amp;amp; = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau diag\left[ 1 - \left(\boldsymbol{h}^{(t)}\right)^2 \right] \boldsymbol{h}^{(t - 1)} \nabla_{\boldsymbol{h}^{(t)}}\mathcal{L} \
&amp;amp; = \sum_{t = 1}^\tau diag\left[ 1 - \left(\boldsymbol{h}^{(t)}\right)^2 \right] \left( \nabla_{\boldsymbol{h}^{(t)}}\mathcal{L} \right) {\boldsymbol{h}^{(t - 1)}}^\intercal

$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equation above leaves us with a term $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{h}^{(t)}}\mathcal{L}$, which we calculate next. Note that
the back propagation on $\boldsymbol{h}^{(t)}$ has source from both $\boldsymbol{o}^{(t)}$ and
$\boldsymbol{h}^{(t + 1)}$. It&apos;s gradient, therefore, is given by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{align}

$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the 2nd term
$\boldsymbol{W_{xh}}^\intercal \nabla_{\boldsymbol{h}^{(t + 1)}}\mathcal{L} \left( diag\left[ 1 - (\boldsymbol{h}^{(t + 1)})^2 \right] \right)$
is zero at first iteration propagating back because for the last-layer (unrolled) of RNN , there&apos;s no gradient update
flow from the next hidden state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have derived backpropagating rule for $W_{hh}$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engaging in a conversation with a company&apos;s AI assistant can be frustrating. Chatbots give themselves away by returning
generic responses that often don&apos;t answer the question. This is because Large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI&apos;s GPT
models, excel at general language tasks but have trouble answering specific questions for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LLMs have a broad knowledge base but often lack in-depth industry- or organization-specific context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LLMs may generate responses that are incorrect, known as hallucinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LLMs lack explainability, as they can&apos;t verify, trace, or cite sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An LLM&apos;s knowledge is based on static training data that doesn&apos;t update with real-time information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&apos;t have to be the case. Imagine a different scenario: interacting with a chatbot that provides detailed,
precise responses. This chatbot sounds like a human with deep institutional knowledge about the company and its products
and policies. This chatbot is actually helpful. The second scenario is possible through a machine learning approach
called &lt;strong&gt;Retrieval-Augmented Generation&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;RAG&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAG is a technique that enhances Large Language Model (LLM) responses by retrieving source information from external
data stores to augment generated responses. These data stores, including databases, documents, or websites, may contain
domain-specific, proprietary data that enable the LLM to locate and summarize specific, contextual information beyond
the data the LLM was trained on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAG applications are becoming the industry standard for organizations that want smarter generative AI applications. With
RAG, we can reduce hallucination, provide explainability, draw upon the most recent data, and expand the range of what
our LLM can answer. As we improve the quality and specificity of its response, we also &lt;strong&gt;create a better user
experience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How Does RAG Work?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a high level, the RAG architecture involves 3 key processes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;understanding queries&lt;/strong&gt;: the process begins when a user asks a question. The query goes through the LLM API to the
RAG application, which analyzes it to understand the user&apos;s intent and determine what information to look for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;retrieving information&lt;/strong&gt;: the application uses advanced algorithms to find the most relevant pieces of information
in the company&apos;s database. These algorithms match vector embeddings based on semantic similarity to identify the
information that can best answer the user&apos;s question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;generating responses&lt;/strong&gt;: the application combines the retrieved information with the user&apos;s original prompt to
create a more detailed and context-rich prompt. It then uses the new prompt to generate a response tailored to the
organization&apos;s internal data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/rag.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before implementing an RAG application, it&apos;s important to clean up our data to make it easy for the RAG application to
quickly search and retrieve relevant information. This process is called &lt;strong&gt;data indexing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frameworks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/&quot;&gt;LangChain make it easy to build RAG applications&lt;/a&gt; by
providing a unified interface to connect LLMs to external databases via APIs.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://neo4j.com/blog/developer/langchain-library-full-support-neo4j-vector-index/&quot;&gt;Neo4j vector index&lt;/a&gt; on the
LangChain library helps simplify the indexing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;RAG is Not the Final Answer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People just started building RAG systems would feel like magic: retrieve the right documents and let the model generate.
No hallucinations or hand holding, and we get clean and grounded answers. But then the cracks showed over time. RAG
worked fine on simple questions, but when the input is longer and poorly structured, or when multi-step reasoning is
involved, it starts to struggle. Tweaking chunk sizes or plying with hybrid search for example have been shown to
improve the output only &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core issue is that RAG retrieves but it doesn&apos;t reason or plan. Due to its limitations, RAG has been widely regarded
a &lt;em&gt;starting point&lt;/em&gt;, not a solution. if we are inputting real world queries, we need memory and planning. One better
example would be to wrap RAG in a task planner instead of endless fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if we use RAG with some technical manuals and ask &quot;explain this differently, make it easier to digest, and
give me a class on this subject as an instructor would&quot;. That is going to be a great use case for RAG when paired with a
strong prompt strategy and clear retrieval scope. If the technical manuals are well-structured and chunked, a RAG system
can definitely retrieve relevant sections and reframe them into simplified, instructional content. For more dynamic
behavior like teaching styles, adapting explanations to learner feedback, or building a step-by-step curriculum,
however, we would likely benefit from layering in agentic behavior or an instructional persona agent on top of RAG.
That&apos;s where combining memory, reasoning, and planning starts to elevate the experience beyond static retrieval.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://notebooklm.google.com/&quot;&gt;Googles Notebook LM&lt;/a&gt; would be a good playground to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not RAG&apos;s fault, because &lt;strong&gt;&quot;RAG cannot plan&quot; is like saying Elasticsearch or Google search cannot plan. These
are information retrieval systems, they are not supposed to plan anything but to retrieve information&lt;/strong&gt;. If we want
planning capabilities, we should add agents and that is a very different level of complexity. Therefore people
interested in exploring this direction is recommended checking out
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Denis2054/Building-Business-Ready-Generative-AI-Systems&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building Business-Ready Generative AI Systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
It goes deep into combining RAG with agentic design, memory, and reasoning flows basically everything that starts where
traditional RAG ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, RAG should be a component of agentic frameworks that we use to get our system to reply
appropriately beyond the information retrieval. &lt;strong&gt;Planning would be a true AI feature, LLMs are not it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;GraphRAG&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than using documents as a source to vectorize and retrieve from,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn-graphrag.qubitpi.org/&quot;&gt;Knowledge Graphs&lt;/a&gt; can be used. One can start with a set of documents,
books, or other bodies of text, and convert them to a knowledge graph using one of many methods, including language
models. Once the knowledge graph is created, subgraphs can be vectorized, stored in a vector database, and used for
retrieval as in plain RAG. The advantage here is that graphs has more recognizable structure than strings of text and
this structure can help retrieve more relevant facts for generation. This approach is called &lt;strong&gt;GraphRAG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reinforcement Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from the K-Armed Bandit Problem at the beginning of &lt;a href=&quot;#approximation-theory&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, we now look more closely
at methods for estimating the values of actions and for using the estimates to make action selection decisions, which we
collectively call &lt;strong&gt;action-value methods&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note[Action-Value Methods]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 parts involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An estimation method for the value of an action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use the estimates to select action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that the true value of an action is the mean reward when that action is selected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q_t(a) = \mathbb{E}[R_t|A_t = a] = \frac{\text{sum of rewards when action } a \text{ taken prior to } t}{\text{number of times } a \text{ taken prior to } t} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{t - 1}R_i \dot X_{A_i = a}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{t - 1}X_{A_i = a}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $X_{\text{predicate}}$ denotes the random variable that is 1 if &lt;em&gt;predicate&lt;/em&gt; is true and 0 if it is not.
If action $a$ is not taken at all, i.e. the denominator is $0$, then we give $Q_t(a)$ some default value, such as $0$.
In addition, $Q_t(a)$ should converge to $q_*(a)$ as the denominator goes to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equation above assumes that the estimate value is calculated by averaging the rewards actually received. In this
sense, we call this the &lt;em&gt;sample-average&lt;/em&gt; method for estimating action values. &lt;em&gt;It should be noted that this is just one
way to estimate action values&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the question of how the estimate might be used to selection actions, the simplest selection rule is to select the
one with the highest estimated value, i.e. a greedy action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A_t = \argmax_a Q_t(a)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a regular AI review session in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/QubitPi/gearbox/pull/23#discussion_r2260539188&quot;&gt;a pull request&lt;/a&gt; on one of my projects. Little
background - I was implementing a general BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm which can be whipped as a JAR library
into one of my developing Java webservices to solve various business problems. To boost its generality, I decided to
implement it using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor&quot;&gt;Visitor pattern&lt;/a&gt;, which by design is able to
separate the fixed algorithm and variable business logic and, therefore, make the algorithm applicable to general use
cases. The code below shows the &lt;em&gt;simplified&lt;/em&gt; version of my first draft sent to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code&quot;&gt;gemini-code-assist&lt;/a&gt; for review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The irrelevant codes, such as Javadoc, &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;s, null-checks, etc., have been removed to highlight the essentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The complete conversation between AI and me can be found in the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/QubitPi/gearbox/pull/23&quot;&gt;original pull request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface NodeVisitor {

    void visit(AbstractNode node);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public abstract class AbstractNode {

    void accept(final NodeVisitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static void traverse(final AbstractNode startNode, final NodeVisitor visitor) {
    final Deque&amp;lt;AbstractNode&amp;gt; queue = new ArrayDeque&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(Collections.singleton(startNode));
    final Set&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; visited = new HashSet&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(Collections.singleton(startNode.getLabel()));

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        final AbstractNode currentNode = queue.removeFirst();
        currentNode.accept(visitor);
        for (final AbstractNode neighbor : currentNode.getNeighbors()) {
            if (!visited.contains(neighbor.getLabel())) {
                visited.add(neighbor.getLabel());
                queue.addLast(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having analyzed the code above, the Gemini AI review found a performance issue and argued that if &lt;code&gt;traverse&lt;/code&gt; method is
applied to a large dataset, the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop above could take a lot of time. So the AI figured out a way for
the early termination of the loop with the following review comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/conversation-with-ai.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the AI is asking me to &lt;strong&gt;break the strict Visitor pattern for a performance gain&lt;/strong&gt; by changing the return
type of &lt;code&gt;NodeVisitor.visit(AbstractNode node)&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;. This almost immediately triggered my opposition
and I left my response as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/conversation-with-ai-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response focused on telling AI returning &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; in this case was &lt;strong&gt;not a standard&lt;/strong&gt; Visitor practice. The AI,
however, is resisting with the following followup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/conversation-with-ai-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man what a thoughtful challenge... What&apos;s interesting though is I started to feel a common tension in software design:
balancing &lt;strong&gt;strict adherence to a pattern&apos;s principles&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;real-world performance needs&lt;/strong&gt;. I keep defending the
&lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; return in &lt;code&gt;visit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/conversation-with-ai-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story went on...The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/QubitPi/gearbox/pull/23&quot;&gt;original pull request&lt;/a&gt; had all the followup
details and it&apos;s enough for us to transcendentalize the topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The AI really masters communicating &lt;em&gt;professionally&lt;/em&gt; in the tech debate, and more importantly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started to ask: &lt;strong&gt;what are the two conflicting philosophical or psychological ideologies behind this BFS design
debate between human and machine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turning Point - From &quot;Code Review Debates&quot; to &quot;Ideologies Conflicts&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate over the &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; versus &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; return type for a &lt;code&gt;visit&lt;/code&gt; method in a BFS Visitor pattern implementation,
particularly concerning early termination, actually stems from two conflicting philosophical or psychological ideologies
in software design: &lt;strong&gt;Purism (or Idealism) vs. Pragmatism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idealism&lt;/strong&gt; champions strict adherence to design patterns and principles (like the &lt;em&gt;Single Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;Command-Query Separation&lt;/em&gt;). From a purist perspective, the &lt;em&gt;Visitor&lt;/em&gt;&apos;s sole responsibility is to perform an
operation on the visited element, not to dictate the flow of the traversal. Returning a &lt;em&gt;boolean&lt;/em&gt; for control flow
introduces a coupling that compromises the pattern&apos;s intended separation of concerns. The traversal algorithm (&lt;em&gt;BFS&lt;/em&gt;)
should be generic and complete its traversal of reachable nodes, while the &lt;em&gt;Visitor&lt;/em&gt; focuses purely on the
element-specific action. This approach values the elegance, maintainability, and long-term extensibility that comes from
clear, decoupled responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idealism favors the perspective of &lt;em&gt;Generality&lt;/em&gt;, which emphasizes creating reusable, broadly applicable algorithms. The
&lt;a href=&quot;#how-the-lesson-started-by-accident&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;traverse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method designed for generality aims to visit all reachable nodes,
regardless of the visitor&apos;s internal goal. It&apos;s a foundational traversal primitive. Making it stop early based on a
visitor&apos;s signal would specialize it into a &quot;search-and-terminate&quot; algorithm, potentially limiting its utility for other
scenarios that genuinely require a full traversal (e.g., calculating graph properties, building a complete map of
connections). This aligns with the idea of building robust, foundational components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pragmatism&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, prioritizes practical outcomes and efficiency over strict theoretical purity. A
pragmatic designer would argue that if a slight deviation from a pattern&apos;s rigid definition (like returning a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;
from &lt;code&gt;visit&lt;/code&gt;) leads to significant performance improvements (e.g., avoiding unnecessary computation on large graphs),
it&apos;s a worthwhile trade-off. The goal is to build effective software that meets real-world demands, and sometimes that
means adapting patterns to fit specific performance requirements. This approach values utility, performance, and solving
immediate problems efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragmatism possesses the viewpoint of &lt;em&gt;specific optimization&lt;/em&gt; that focuses on optimizing for a particular use case, such
as finding a target node as quickly as possible. For this specific scenario, continuing the traversal after the target
is found is clearly inefficient. The argument is that if a common and critical use case (like searching) can be made
significantly faster by a minor adjustment to the API, that optimization should be considered. This prioritizes the
performance of a frequently executed operation over the absolute theoretical purity of the general traversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Two Conflicting Personalities behind the Two Software Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different personality types can drive these software design debates as well. In the &lt;a href=&quot;#how-the-lesson-started-by-accident&quot;&gt;context of the BFS visitor pattern
discussion&lt;/a&gt;, two conflicting personalities often emerge: the &lt;strong&gt;Architect&lt;/strong&gt; and the
&lt;strong&gt;Hacker&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Architect&quot; in this section is NOT to be confused with the &quot;Architect&quot; within the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
framework. The use of &quot;Architect&quot; and &quot;Hacker&quot; was intended to describe archetypes or roles in software development,
representing distinct philosophical approaches to design, rather than strictly adhering to formal psychological
personality typing systems like the 16-Personality scheme. The fact that MBTI also has an &quot;Architect&quot; (INTJ) type, which
often describes individuals with strong logical, strategic, and planning tendencies, is a &lt;strong&gt;coincidence of terminology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Architect 🏛️&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Architect embodies the &lt;strong&gt;Purism/Idealism&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Generality&lt;/em&gt; ideologies. This personality is deeply concerned with
the long-term health, scalability, and maintainability of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Architect, the Visitor pattern&apos;s strength lies in its clear &lt;em&gt;separation of concerns&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;visit&lt;/code&gt; method should
only perform an operation on the element, not control the traversal. Deviating from this feels like a compromise of
the pattern&apos;s integrity. Architects practices &lt;strong&gt;strict adherence to patterns&lt;/strong&gt;. They design the BFS algorithm to be a
truly &lt;strong&gt;general-purpose&lt;/strong&gt; traversal mechanism, capable of being used for any scenario where we need to visit every
reachable node. Optimizing for a single &quot;search&quot; use case by baking termination logic into the &lt;code&gt;visit&lt;/code&gt; method feels like
specializing a general tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance optimizations are important, but not at the expense of muddying the design, making it harder to understand,
or limiting future extensibility. Architects argue that for most graphs, the overhead of continuing a few extra
iterations after a target is found is negligible, and for truly massive graphs, a &lt;strong&gt;long-term view&lt;/strong&gt; of more fundamental
architectural changes might be needed anyway. They prioritize &lt;strong&gt;correctness over convenience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Core motivations of Architect]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;elegance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;correctness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consistency, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;future-proofing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architects believe in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.qubitpi.org/posts/software-is-about-making-it-right/&quot;&gt;doing things &quot;the right way&quot;&lt;/a&gt; according to established
patterns and principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hacker 💻&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hacker (in the positive sense of a clever problem-solver, not a malicious one) embodies the &lt;strong&gt;Pragmatism&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;specific optimization&lt;/em&gt; ideologies. They are driven by getting things done efficiently and solving immediate,
high-impact problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they appreciate patterns, they honor &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Get it done&quot; mentality&lt;/strong&gt; and are willing to bend or adapt them if it leads
to a clear and measurable performance gain, especially for common use cases. If a search operation is a critical
bottleneck for large graphs, they put &lt;strong&gt;performance first&lt;/strong&gt; and see the continued traversal after finding the target as
a waste of resources. A &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; return that allows the traversal to immediately stop is a direct and effective
solution to this problem. Hackers are more focused on the &lt;strong&gt;short-term impact&lt;/strong&gt; of the immediate, measurable benefits of
an optimization. The &quot;slight deviation&quot; from pattern purity is a small price to pay for a &quot;significant performance
improvement.&quot; They prioritize &lt;strong&gt;convenience over correctness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Core motivations of Hacker]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tangible results, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practical solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers are focused on making the current system perform optimally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Different Past Personal Experiences Could Lead to Such a Diverted World-View like Architect v.s. Hacker?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different past personal experiences often shape the divergent worldviews of the &quot;Architect&quot; and &quot;Hacker&quot; in software
design. These experiences cultivate distinct priorities, risk tolerances, and problem-solving approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people possess traits from both, and their experiences can lead to a more balanced approach over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Architect&apos;s Formative Experiences 🏛️&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Architect&quot; mindset is typically forged in environments where &lt;strong&gt;stability&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;scalability&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;long-term
maintainability&lt;/strong&gt;, and risk mitigation are paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working on Large, Complex, and Long-Lived Systems&lt;/strong&gt;: Think enterprise software, financial systems, aerospace, or
critical infrastructure. In these domains, a single bug can have catastrophic consequences (financial loss, safety
hazards). Architects learn the hard way that quick fixes often lead to compounding
&lt;a href=&quot;https://neontri.com/blog/enterprise-software-development/#technical-debt&quot;&gt;technical debt&lt;/a&gt; and instability over
years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiencing the Pain of Technical Debt&lt;/strong&gt;: They&apos;ve likely inherited or worked on systems that were initially
&quot;hacked&quot; together for speed. They&apos;ve spent countless hours debugging, refactoring, and trying to extend brittle
codebases, leading to a deep appreciation for upfront design and robust architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involvement in System Outages or Critical Bugs&lt;/strong&gt;: Being on call for major incidents caused by poor design, lack of
testing, or insufficient planning teaches them the severe consequences of prioritizing speed over stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formal Education and Mentorship&lt;/strong&gt;: Often, Architects have a strong academic background in computer science,
emphasizing theoretical correctness, algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles. They may also
have been mentored by senior engineers who instilled a disciplined approach to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working in Regulated Industries&lt;/strong&gt;: Industries with strict compliance requirements (e.g., healthcare, finance,
government) necessitate meticulous design, extensive documentation, and rigorous testing, reinforcing a methodical and
risk-averse approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These experiences instill a deep-seated value for &lt;strong&gt;structure&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;predictability&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;preventing future problems&lt;/strong&gt;,
even if it means a slower initial pace. They see the entire lifecycle of software and understand the compounding cost of
shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Hacker&apos;s Formative Experiences 💻&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Hacker&quot; mindset, in its positive sense, often develops in environments that prioritize &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;rapid
iteration&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;immediate impact&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;direct problem-solving&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Startup or Fast-Paced Environments&lt;/strong&gt;: In startups, the primary goal is often to find product-market fit quickly,
ship features rapidly, and iterate based on user feedback. Survival depends on speed, and &quot;perfect&quot; architecture can
be seen as a luxury that delays crucial market entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being a &quot;Hero&quot; Problem Solver&lt;/strong&gt;: They might have gained recognition for quickly fixing urgent production issues,
implementing features under tight deadlines, or building prototypes that demonstrate immediate value. This reinforces
the idea that direct action and quick results are highly valued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Taught or Project-Based Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: Many &quot;Hackers&quot; are highly skilled self-starters who learned by doing,
experimenting, and building. Their knowledge is often gained through practical application and overcoming immediate
technical hurdles, rather than through abstract theoretical study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projects with Short Lifespans or Disposable Prototypes&lt;/strong&gt;: If a project is meant to be a proof-of-concept or has a
limited expected lifespan, the long-term architectural concerns become less relevant than getting it working quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Direct Performance Gains&lt;/strong&gt;: They are often acutely aware of performance bottlenecks and driven to optimize
code directly for speed, seeing any &quot;unnecessary&quot; abstraction or indirection as a barrier to efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These experiences cultivate a strong bias towards &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;delivering tangible results now&lt;/strong&gt;.
They are less concerned with hypothetical future problems and more focused on solving the current challenge in the most
direct way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Psychological&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain early life experiences and inherent temperaments can also predispose individuals to lean towards an &quot;Architect&quot;
or &quot;Hacker&quot; worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early experiences often lay the groundwork for how individuals approach challenges, deal with uncertainty, and
prioritize different aspects of a solution. It is, therefore, important to remember that these are tendencies, not
deterministic paths. Many individuals develop a blend of these traits, and &lt;a href=&quot;#technical&quot;&gt;professional experience&lt;/a&gt; will
reinforce or modify these predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;For the &quot;Architect&quot; Mindset 🏛️&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Architect&apos;s preference for structure, planning, and long-term stability often stems from experiences that emphasize
&lt;strong&gt;order&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;consequences&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;thoroughness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are positive forces that drives one into this direction. Children raised in environments with clear, consistently
enforced rules and predictable consequences may develop a strong internal sense of order and a belief in the importance
of adherence to established guidelines. They learn that following rules prevents negative outcomes and leads to
stability. If parents or caregivers encouraged planning, thinking ahead, and considering the long-term implications of
actions (e.g., &quot;What happens if we don&apos;t save money now?&quot;), this can foster a systematic, preventative mindset. Growing
up in a household where tasks were expected to be completed meticulously, with attention to detail and a focus on
durability (e.g., &quot;Do it right the first time, so you don&apos;t have to do it again&quot;), can instill a deep appreciation for
robust solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative forces can come into play as well. This could be anything from a chaotic household where things frequently went
wrong due to lack of planning, to observing poorly organized projects in school or community activities. Experiencing
the negative consequences of disorder can create a strong desire to build robust, resilient systems. If they frequently
encountered systems or processes that were unreliable, broke easily, or were difficult to understand, it could foster a
drive to design for stability and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a personality traits, potentially innate or early-developed, perspective, individuals naturally high in
conscientiousness (a Big Five personality trait) tend to be organized, disciplined,
dutiful, and prefer planned behavior. This aligns well with the Architect&apos;s need for structure and foresight. A natural
aversion to risk or uncertainty might lead someone to prefer designs that minimize potential failure points and
prioritize predictability. A predisposition for breaking down problems into components, understanding interdependencies,
and seeing the &quot;big picture&quot; from an early age (e.g., enjoying complex puzzles, building intricate models) can translate
into architectural thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;For the &quot;Hacker&quot; Mindset 💻&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Hacker&apos;s&quot; drive for rapid iteration, immediate solutions, and direct impact often stems from experiences that
reward &lt;strong&gt;adaptability&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;quick problem-solving&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;tangible results&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mind set usually result from the early experiences in Resource-Constrained or Fast-Paced Environments. Growing up
in situations where resources were scarce, and creative, immediate solutions were necessary to overcome challenges, can
foster a &quot;hack it together&quot; mentality. They learn to be resourceful and prioritize getting something working over
perfect execution. Hobbies like building with LEGOs or playing video games where immediate actions lead to immediate,
visible results reinforce a preference for quick iterations, rapid feedback loops and tangible progress. A childhood
spent tinkering, disassembling things to see how they work, and experimenting with solutions (even if they were &quot;messy&quot;)
can lead to a comfort with trial-and-error and a focus on functional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals high in openness tend to be curious, inventive, and prefer novelty. This can manifest as a desire to explore
new solutions quickly and a willingness to deviate from established norms. A comfort with uncertainty and a willingness
to take calculated risks (e.g., trying unconventional solutions, not needing a complete plan before starting) can drive
a more experimental, pragmatic approach. A personality that prefers to jump in and start building rather than spending
extensive time planning. They learn by doing and iterating. The intense satisfaction of quickly solving a problem or
seeing a piece of code immediately work can be a powerful motivator, leading them to prioritize rapid implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Does AI Favors Hacker Mindset?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that AI code reviewer leans towards a &quot;Hacker&quot; ideology highlights some fundamental differences between how
humans and current AI models &quot;think&quot; about software design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optimization Based on Quantifiable Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI models, especially those for code generation or review, are often trained to optimize for &lt;strong&gt;quantifiable metrics&lt;/strong&gt;.
These metrics are typically things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;execution speed - How fast does the code run?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memory usage - How much memory does it consume?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lines of code/conciseness - Is the solution compact?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pass/fail rate - Does it correctly solve the immediate problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Hacker&quot; approach directly correlates with these metrics. A quick, pragmatic solution that achieves immediate
performance gains is highly rewarded by such metrics. Returning &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; to terminate a loop immediately provides a
clear, measurable performance improvement. Concepts like &quot;separation of concerns,&quot; &quot;extensibility,&quot; &quot;maintainability,&quot;
&quot;readability for future developers,&quot; or &quot;reducing technical debt&quot; are much harder for an AI to directly quantify and
optimize for. They are abstract, human-centric values that &lt;em&gt;don&apos;t easily translate into numerical scores&lt;/em&gt; in the same
way execution time does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bias in Training Data Reflected by Human&apos;s Business Push&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large language models are trained on vast datasets of code from repositories like &lt;em&gt;GitHub&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/em&gt;, and
competitive programming platforms. Solutions on platforms like &lt;em&gt;LeetCode&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;HackerRank&lt;/em&gt; often prioritize optimal time
and space complexity for a specific problem over long-term architectural elegance or extensibility. A &lt;em&gt;boolean&lt;/em&gt; return
for early termination is a common, efficient pattern in such contexts. While open-source projects can be
well-architected, many also contain pragmatic solutions or &quot;hacks&quot; that were necessary to &lt;strong&gt;ship features quickly or
address immediate needs&lt;/strong&gt;. The sheer volume of &quot;working code&quot; might implicitly favor functionality and immediate
performance over strict adherence to design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AI Doesn&apos;t &quot;Feel&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An AI doesn&apos;t experience the human pain of technical debt, such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the late-night debugging sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the frustration of refactoring brittle code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the missed deadlines due to unforeseen architectural limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t &quot;feel&quot; the pain of &quot;Technical Debt&quot; or the long-term cost of a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; solution. An AI doesn&apos;t
have a &quot;future self&quot; that will have to maintain the code it generates 5 years down the line. Its objective is typically
to provide the &quot;best&quot; output now based on its current training and prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architectural patterns are often about making code easier for &lt;strong&gt;humans&lt;/strong&gt; to understand, collaborate on, and maintain
over years. An AI doesn&apos;t participate in team meetings, doesn&apos;t onboard new developers, and doesn&apos;t struggle with
cognitive load when reading complex, tightly coupled code. Its &quot;understanding&quot; is statistical, not experiential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI excels at recognizing patterns in data. If it sees that &lt;em&gt;boolean&lt;/em&gt; returns in traversal methods are frequently
associated with higher performance in its training data for search-like tasks, it will learn to suggest that pattern.
On the other side of the spectrum, abstract design principles like the &lt;em&gt;Single Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt; or the
&lt;em&gt;Open/Closed Principle&lt;/em&gt; require a level of &lt;strong&gt;abstract reasoning&lt;/strong&gt; about software evolution and human factors that current
AI models struggle with. They can describe these principles if trained on text about them, but applying them
&lt;strong&gt;creatively&lt;/strong&gt; and contextually in code generation is still a frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contemporary AI does NOT know how to feel&lt;/strong&gt;, a complex human capability rooted in our psychological
subconsciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works involving creative abstract reasoning are less likely to be taken over by contemporary AI, which lacks the
holistic, long-term, and human-centric perspective that an Architect brings to software design. This is precisely why
human oversight and architectural guidance &lt;em&gt;remain&lt;/em&gt; crucial in software development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turning Point - From &quot;Ideologies Conflicts&quot; to &quot;Philosophical Standing&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a conceptual way, the tension between the &quot;Architect&quot; and &quot;Hacker&quot; ideologies in software design mirrors the
philosophical conflict between &lt;strong&gt;Determinism&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Libertarianism&lt;/strong&gt; regarding free will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Philosophy Review]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determinism&lt;/strong&gt;: The philosophical view that all events, including human actions and choices, are ultimately
determined by prior causes and the laws of nature. If we knew all the preceding conditions and laws, we could, in
principle, perfectly predict the future. From this perspective, &quot;free will&quot; in the sense of truly uncaused choices is
an illusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libertarianism (Metaphysical)&lt;/strong&gt;: The philosophical view that at least some human actions are genuinely free, meaning
they are not entirely determined by prior causes. It posits that agents (people) have the power to make real choices
and &quot;could have done otherwise&quot; under the exact same circumstances. This often implies some form of indeterminism in
the universe, particularly regarding human consciousness or decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current AI models, including large language models, are fundamentally deterministic. Their &quot;decisions&quot; and outputs are
the result of complex algorithms, statistical probabilities learned from vast datasets, and intricate mathematical
computations. Given the exact same input and internal state, an AI will, in principle, produce the exact same output.
There&apos;s no &quot;magic&quot; or uncaused choice; it&apos;s a consequence of its programming and training data&lt;/p&gt;

There
are a number of reasons for this, ranging from the intellectual and practical to the emotional and psychological.
</description><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a new Roman villa or the deciphering of an ancient scroll still captivates our imagination. But why do
some people feel such a strong pull toward things from the past, like ancient languages? It&apos;s a question that goes
beyond simple curiosity, touching on some of the deepest aspects of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, our fascination with the past is driven by two powerful forces: the
&lt;a href=&quot;#the-practical-developing-critical-thinking&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;practical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;#the-psychological-nostalgia-and-a-longing-for-the-past&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;psychological&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Practical: Developing Critical Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying ancient languages and literatures requires rigorous analysis, critical evaluation of sources, and the ability
to synthesize fragmented evidence. It&apos;s a mental workout that builds skills in research, &lt;strong&gt;problem-solving&lt;/strong&gt;, and
&lt;strong&gt;logical reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;, which are applicable to many different fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how reading ancient Greek or Latin texts develops critical thinking, for example, consider a passage from
a historical account, such as a work by the Roman historian Tacitus. Imagine we are a student reading a section of
Tacitus&apos; &lt;em&gt;Annals&lt;/em&gt;, which details the reign of Emperor Tiberius. We come across a passage where Tacitus describes a
particular senator, Sejanus, as being power-hungry, manipulative, and a major threat to the emperor. Tacitus presents
this view with strong, often loaded, language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;questioning the source&lt;/strong&gt;, we first recognize that Tacitus is not a neutral observer. He was writing decades after
the events he describes, during a time when his political sympathies were decidedly anti-imperial. Critical thinking
prompts us to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was Tacitus&apos;s purpose in writing this? Was he trying to present an objective history, or was he using the past to
critique the present?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were his sources of information? Did he have access to firsthand accounts, or was he relying on rumors and later
historical works?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might his personal biases have influenced his portrayal of Sejanus?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latin and Greek are highly structured and rich in rhetorical devices. Analyzing how Tacitus presents his information is
also, quite on the contrary, part of practicing the critical thinking. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is he using direct statements, or is he employing irony and insinuation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What specific words does he choose to describe Sejanus? Are they neutral adjectives, or are they emotionally charged?
For example, does he use a word like &quot;ambitious&quot; or a more damning term like &quot;treacherous&quot;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the grammatical structure of the sentence? Is the emphasis placed on Sejanus&apos;s actions or on his motivations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Tacitus example, &lt;strong&gt;analyzing the language and rhetoric&lt;/strong&gt; is not just about appreciating his writing style; it&apos;s
the very core of critical thinking because it helps us understand the situation &lt;em&gt;subjectively&lt;/em&gt;. This might seem
counterintuitive - we think of critical thinking as leading to objectivity - &lt;strong&gt;but in the context of ancient history,
understanding the author&apos;s subjectivity is the only path to a more objective understanding of the event itself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tacitus writes, he isn&apos;t a modern journalist striving for neutrality. He is a Roman aristocrat writing with a
specific worldview.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://dcc.dickinson.edu/tacitus-annals/introduction/tacitus-style#footnote-018-backlink&quot;&gt;By analyzing his language, we can &lt;strong&gt;identify his intent and bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
There are at least 2 approaches for doing this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loaded Words&lt;/em&gt;: Tacitus uses the Latin word &lt;em&gt;perfidus&lt;/em&gt; to describe Sejanus. While a dictionary might translate it
simply as &quot;treacherous,&quot; the word carries a heavy moral weight. It&apos;s not just a description of an action but a moral
condemnation. A critical reader notes this word choice and thinks: &quot;Tacitus isn&apos;t just reporting that Sejanus
betrayed someone; he is explicitly telling me that Sejanus is a bad person.&quot; This reveals Tacitus&apos;s perspective and
his desire to shape the reader&apos;s opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hestia-blog.squarespace.com/blog/tacitus-rhetoric-and-reporting-power#:~:text=As%20such%2C%20Tacitus%20conceals%20his,larger%20structural%20and%20thematic%20features.&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhetorical Devices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: can make writer&apos;s point without explicitly stating it. Tacitus might use &lt;em&gt;insinuation&lt;/em&gt; or
&lt;em&gt;juxtaposition&lt;/em&gt;. For example, he might describe Sejanus&apos;s rise to power and then, in the very next sentence,
mention a sudden, unexplained illness of Tiberius&apos;s son. He never directly accuses Sejanus of poisoning the son, but
by placing the two facts together, he guides the reader to a suspicious conclusion. A critical reader recognizes this
rhetorical move and understands that Tacitus is crafting a narrative, not just presenting a timeline of events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, analyzing the language helps us &lt;strong&gt;draw the line between &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;interpretation&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; which has become
blurry. For example, Tacitus might state, &quot;Sejanus was the commander of
the Praetorian Guard.&quot; This is a factual statement that can be corroborated. However, when he writes, &quot;Sejanus, swollen
with arrogant ambition, began to dominate the emperor,&quot; he is offering an interpretation of Sejanus&apos;s motivations. By
paying close attention to the adjectives (&lt;em&gt;arrogant&lt;/em&gt;) and adverbs (&lt;em&gt;dominate&lt;/em&gt;), a critical reader can separate the
verifiable fact from the author&apos;s subjective judgment. We learn not what &lt;em&gt;happened&lt;/em&gt;, but what &lt;em&gt;Tacitus thought about&lt;/em&gt;
what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tacitus often uses language designed to evoke emotion - outrage, fear, or contempt. By studying his syntax and word
choice, we can see how he is trying to manipulate his readers&apos; feelings. A critical reader asks: &quot;Why is he trying to
make me feel this way? What is his ultimate goal in arousing this emotion?&quot; We are essentially &lt;strong&gt;reverse-engineering the
text&apos;s persuasive effect&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing Tacitus&apos;s language and rhetoric doesn&apos;t make us more objective in a simple, straightforward way. Instead, it
makes us &lt;strong&gt;critically aware of the author&apos;s subjectivity&lt;/strong&gt;. We learn to see Tacitus as a product of his time and his
class, with his own agendas and biases. By understanding his subjective perspective, we can then more accurately weigh
his testimony against other sources (Suetonius, Cassius Dio, archaeological evidence) and piece together a more nuanced
and &quot;objective&quot; picture of what actually occurred in Tiberius&apos;s court. We don&apos;t just read history; we learn to read the
historian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical reader doesn&apos;t stop with Tacitus. They would then &lt;strong&gt;look for other sources to compare and contrast&lt;/strong&gt;. They
would read the works of other ancient historians who wrote about the same period, such as Suetonius or Cassius Dio to
see if their accounts of Sejanus match Tacitus&apos;s and where do they differ. They also might consider the political
climate to verify whether Sejanus is truly a threat to the emperor, or was he a scapegoat for Tiberius&apos;s own unpopular
policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By engaging in this process, we move beyond simply translating the words on the page. we are actively evaluating the
information, questioning the author&apos;s intent, and building a more nuanced and accurate picture of historical events.
This process of critical analysis is the core of historical scholarship and is a fundamental skill developed by studying
ancient texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Differing from Contemporary Materials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the process above can also be achieved through contemporary news reading. After all, critical thinking is vital for
reading contemporary news, and the skills we use - like questioning the source, identifying bias, and looking for
corroborating evidence - are fundamentally the same. What makes ancient texts special then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s special in this context is the sheer intensity of the critical thinking required, due to a unique set of
challenges and limitations. These challenges that make ancient texts a powerful and distinctive training ground for
critical thinking are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Time and Culture Gap&lt;/strong&gt;: When we read contemporary news, we share a common cultural context with the writer and
the events being reported. We understand the political system, the social norms, and the language nuances. With an
ancient text, we are a complete outsider. This forces us to think about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unknown Biases&lt;/em&gt;: What were the author&apos;s social class, political allegiances, and religious beliefs? We often have
to infer these from limited information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfamiliar Values&lt;/em&gt;: Ancient societies had completely different ethical frameworks. A &quot;hero&quot; in ancient Greek
literature might be a ruthless tyrant by today&apos;s standards. We have to analyze the text on its own terms before we
can evaluate it from a modern perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lost Context&lt;/em&gt;: We are missing so much information. We don&apos;t have the &quot;live broadcasts&quot; or &quot;interviews&quot; that a
modern journalist has. The text is often a fragment of a larger work, and many other sources from that time period
are lost forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem of Physical Survival&lt;/strong&gt;: A modern news article is easily verified or debunked by a vast network of other
sources, photos, and digital archives. An ancient text exists as a physical object - a manuscript - that has been
copied by hand over centuries, often with errors, deliberate changes, and missing parts. This adds a whole new layer
of critical thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Textual Criticism&lt;/em&gt;: We have to analyze the different surviving manuscripts to reconstruct what the original author
might have written. Was this word or phrase a scribe&apos;s mistake? Was this entire section added later? This is a form
of forensic analysis that is rarely needed for a modern text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Translation Challenges&lt;/em&gt;: The meaning of an ancient word can be contested. A single Latin word might have a dozen
possible translations, and we choice can completely change the interpretation of a passage. This forces us to weigh
evidence and argue for our chosen meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Absence of a &quot;Truth&quot; to Check Against&lt;/strong&gt;: When a modern news source makes a claim, we can often check it against
other news outlets, official statements, or data. With ancient history, there is often no definitive &quot;truth.&quot; The
ancient sources are the evidence. The &quot;truth&quot; is what we can construct from a careful, critical, and humble evaluation
of those sources. Our critical thinking is not just about identifying errors; it&apos;s about building an entire historical
narrative from the ground up, based on a handful of fragmentary documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Developing Critical Thinking Skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing critical thinking skills gradually with ancient texts is a process that builds upon itself, moving from a
foundation of language mechanics to higher-level historical and literary analysis in phases. The idea is to
systematically train our mind to move from literal translation and grammar-based logic to nuanced, multi-layered
critical analysis. This process not only makes us a more careful reader of ancient texts but also a more rigorous and
skeptical reader of all information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Phase 1: Learning Language (Months 1-12)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phase is all about learning the tools of the trade. We can&apos;t critically analyze a text if we can&apos;t read it. It&apos;s
the foundation. Start with the basics. Don&apos;t worry about complex philosophy just yet. Focus on learning the language
itself. Master the grammar and vocabulary of a language like Latin or Ancient Greek. This initial step is a critical
thinking exercise in itself, as we are learning to solve a logical puzzle with every sentence we translate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal amount of time we spend each day during the &quot;Foundations&quot; period should be based on &lt;strong&gt;consistency&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;focused effort&lt;/strong&gt; - a moderate, daily commitment is far more effective than sporadic, long study sessions. A realistic
and sustainable goal for the first 1-12 months would be to aim for &lt;strong&gt;30 to 90 minutes per day, six to seven days a
week&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on &lt;em&gt;how busy&lt;/em&gt; we are on a particular day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 Minutes: The Absolute Minimum.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the time we should aim for even on our busiest days. It&apos;s enough to
review vocabulary flashcards, go over a grammar point from our textbook, or translate a short sentence or two. The
goal here is to maintain daily exposure to the language and prevent ourselves from losing momentum. Consistency is
the most important factor in language learning, and a short daily session is the key to maintaining it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;60 Minutes: The Ideal Sweet Spot.&lt;/strong&gt; An hour a day allows for a more comprehensive session. We can dedicate a portion
of this time to learning &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; material (a new chapter or a set of new vocabulary words) and another portion to
&lt;em&gt;reviewing&lt;/em&gt; old material. This time frame allows us to move at a good pace without feeling overwhelmed. &lt;strong&gt;It&apos;s often
the minimum amount of time recommended by many serious self-learners and can be broken up into smaller chunks
throughout the day if a full hour isn&apos;t possible all at once&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90 Minutes: The Accelerated Approach.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have more time and want to make faster progress, 90 minutes is an
excellent target. With this amount of time, we can tackle more challenging exercises, review material more thoroughly,
and start to build more complex sentences. It allows us to both learn and apply the new information in a single
session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, instead of thinking, &quot;I need to study for 60 minutes,&quot; think about what we will accomplish during that
time. Our study session should be an active process, not a passive one. A good daily plan could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5-10 minutes: Review old vocabulary with flashcards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20-30 minutes: Work through new grammar and examples in our textbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20-30 minutes: Translate a short passage from the textbook or an easy reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5-10 minutes: Recite vocabulary out loud or review the text we just translated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people with jobs are most free after dinner. There are 2 periods at night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After dinner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before sleeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a cognitive and neurological perspective, studying just before we go to sleep at night is generally considered the
more effective of the two options for memorization. The primary reason for this is a process called
&lt;strong&gt;memory consolidation&lt;/strong&gt;. When we sleep, our brain is not inactive; it is working to process, organize, and consolidate
the information we learned while you were awake. This process moves new memories from a short-term, fragile state to a
more stable, long-term state. Studying right before sleep allows this consolidation process to begin with the most
recently learned information fresh in your mind, which can significantly improve recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While studying after dinner might also be effective, it often comes with a few potential drawbacks. The period after a
meal can sometimes be associated with a &quot;post-lunch dip&quot; or a feeling of drowsiness, especially if the meal was large.
Additionally, if there are hours of wakefulness between studying and sleeping, other activities, information, or
distractions can interfere with the memory consolidation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The period directly before sleep has a significant scientific advantage due to the powerful role of sleep in cementing
new information into long-term memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By focusing on daily, consistent, and active engagement, we will build a strong foundation of grammar and vocabulary.
This approach not only makes the process more manageable but also ensures that when we are ready to move to

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Static Text Analysis&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, our critical thinking is focused on a micro-level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify the Parts&lt;/strong&gt;: Our task is to accurately identify nouns, verbs, adjectives, and their relationships. This is
a puzzle-solving exercise. We aew asking: &quot;This noun is in the accusative case; that means it&apos;s the direct object of
this verb. But what if it&apos;s the subject of this infinitive clause?&quot; This constant process of parsing and logical
deduction is a direct exercise in critical thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand Grammar as Meaning&lt;/strong&gt;: We learn that a specific grammatical choice (e.g., the use of the subjunctive mood)
isn&apos;t random; it conveys a particular meaning, such as uncertainty or a hypothetical condition. We are learning to
read the author&apos;s intentions through their grammatical choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Phase 2: The Transition (Months 12-24)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have a firm grasp of grammar, we can start to apply our skills to more complex texts and begin to engage with
the critical analysis aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition from textbook&apos;s simplified passages to real authors, like Caesar, Cicero, or Xenophon. These texts will be
more complex and will present ambiguities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Use a Commentary]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good commentary is our best friend. It won&apos;t give us the answer, but it will provide context, point out potential
ambiguities, and highlight scholarly debates. This is where we learn to &quot;listen&quot; to the critical conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin to read for rhetoric by paying attention to the author&apos;s style. For example, Caesar&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Gallic Wars&lt;/em&gt;, he uses the
third person (&quot;Caesar led his men...&quot;) to create a sense of objectivity and authority, even when writing about his own
actions. We are learning to identify a persuasive technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Phase 3: The Deep Dive (Year 3 Onwards)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we fully develop our critical thinking skills by moving beyond individual texts to a broader historical
and philosophical context what include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;secondary sources&lt;/strong&gt;: Beyond the ancient authors, we will also read what modern scholars say about them. This exposes
us to different interpretations, methodologies, and scholarly debates. We might find two historians who have
completely opposite views on an event described by Livy, and our job is to evaluate their arguments and the evidence
they use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;different genres collectively compared&lt;/strong&gt;: Read a historical text (e.g., Thucydides&apos; &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt;) alongside a
philosophical one (e.g., Plato&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt;) and a play (e.g., a tragedy by &lt;em&gt;Sophocles&lt;/em&gt;) from the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the portrayal of &quot;justice&quot; differ between these 3 genres?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do the authors use their respective forms to convey their ideas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we develop the ability to think interdisciplinarily and to synthesize information from a variety of
sources, which is a hallmark of sophisticated critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Psychological: Nostalgia and a Longing for the Past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/paleography.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some people may have a romanticized view of the past, there is a deep human connection to history that can be
comforting. Thinking about the past can provide a sense of continuity and resilience, reminding us of challenges that
have been overcome and providing a sense of hope for the future. We now discuss the deep-seated mechanisms of human
psychology. While the &lt;a href=&quot;#the-practical-developing-critical-thinking&quot;&gt;previous discussion&lt;/a&gt; focused on the &quot;what&quot; and
&quot;how&quot; of studying ancient texts, we question now gets to the &quot;why&quot; on a personal, emotional level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a well-established concept in Psychology that a person&apos;s obsess to the past is tied to their past experiences,
both personal and cultural. Here we frame it in a particularly compelling way through the lens of ancient languages. But
before we get into that, we first need to learn some Psychologies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Psychology of Nostalgia: A Coping Mechanism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists now understand nostalgia not as a disease (as it was once thought), but as a powerful and generally
positive emotional tool.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miragenews.com/why-we-long-for-the-past-the-science-behind-1013752/#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20previous%20beliefs%20that,stress%2C%20loneliness%2C%20or%20transition.&quot;&gt;^1&lt;/a&gt; It&apos;s often triggered by feelings of loneliness, uncertainty, or stress.&lt;a href=&quot;https://mentalzon.com/en/post/2046/nostalgia-the-surprising-psychology-behind-our-longing-for-the-past#:~:text=Nostalgia%20tends%20to%20loom%20large,isolation%2C%20or%20feelings%20of%20loneliness.&quot;&gt;^2&lt;/a&gt; When we feel
disconnected or overwhelmed in the present, our minds can instinctively reach back into memory for comfort.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/nostalgia#:~:text=Helps%20Shape%20Us-,The%20Emotional%20Comfort%20of%20Nostalgia,can%20give%20us%20emotional%20comfort.&quot;&gt;^3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

writing where everything is symbolic or metaphorical and have to dig for the meaning instead of it just being clearly
stated. For example, reading Newton&apos;s principia feels struggling for really understanding the work not because the
ideas in it are too complicated, but because reaching the ideas feels like going through a maze of unnecessary jargon
to reach them, and by the time one has made it through all that, people become too mentally drained to even digest
what they&apos;re really saying. Is there anything wrong?
</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary source of this post is &lt;em&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/em&gt; unless otherwise cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting assumption that people without background in academic Philosophy think that one have to read the
primary sources with verify little hand holding. Studying both Physics and Philosophy, I have literally never in my life
met someone that tries to access Physics by reading the primary academic literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally nobody interested in Physics starts by trying to read Newton&apos;s principia.  If one is interested in Philosophy
and doesn&apos;t have any training in it, why not start with Philosophy textbooks just like how we study Physics in college?
These university level introductory texts take these complex and often unfriendly primary texts and parse them for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophy (&apos;love of wisdom&apos; in Ancient Greek) is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning
topics like existence, reason, knowledge, value, mind, and language. It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects
on its methods and assumptions. Philosophical questions can be grouped into several branches.
&lt;a href=&quot;#metaphysics&quot;&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#epistemology&quot;&gt;Epistemology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#logic&quot;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt;, and Ethics are sometimes listed as the main branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1A_CAkYt3GY&quot; title=&quot;What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epistemology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epistemology&lt;/strong&gt; is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge. It is also known as &lt;strong&gt;theory of knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; and aims to
understand what knowledge is, how it arises, what its limits are, and what value it has. It further examines the nature
of truth, belief, justification, and rationality. Some of the questions addressed by epistemologists include
&quot;By what method(s) can one acquire knowledge?&quot;; &quot;How is truth established?&quot;; and &quot;Can we prove causal relations?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area in epistemology asks how people acquire knowledge. According to empiricists, all knowledge is based on some
form of experience. Rationalists reject this view and hold that some forms of knowledge, like innate knowledge, are not
acquired through experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the fields of Psychology which is also interested in beliefs and related cognitive processes by studying the
beliefs people actually have and how people acquire them, epistemology explores how people should acquire beliefs. It
determines which beliefs or forms of belief acquisition meet the standards or epistemic goals of knowledge and which
ones fail, thereby providing an evaluation of beliefs. In this regard, epistemology is a normative discipline, whereas
psychology and cognitive sociology are descriptive disciplines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word epistemology comes from the ancient Greek terms &amp;lt;span class=&quot;greek-text&quot;&amp;gt;ἐπιστήμη&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; (&lt;em&gt;episteme&lt;/em&gt;, meaning
&lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt;) and &amp;lt;span class=&quot;greek-text&quot;&amp;gt;λόγος&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; (&lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &lt;em&gt;study of&lt;/em&gt; or reason), literally,
the study of knowledge. Despite its ancient roots, the word itself was only coined in the 19th century to designate this
field as a distinct branch of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Major Schools of Thought&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Skepticism and Fallibilism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophical skepticism questions the human ability to attain knowledge by challenging the foundations upon which
knowledge claims rest. Some skeptics limit their criticism to specific domains of knowledge. For example, religious
skeptics say that it is impossible to know about the existence of deities or the truth of other religious doctrines.
Similarly, moral skeptics challenge the existence of moral knowledge and metaphysical skeptics say that humans cannot
know ultimate reality. External world skepticism questions knowledge of external facts, whereas skepticism about other
minds doubts knowledge of the mental states of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallibilism is another response to skepticism. Fallibilists agree with skeptics that absolute certainty is impossible.
They reject the assumption that knowledge requires absolute certainty, leading them to the conclusion that fallible
knowledge exists. They emphasize the need to keep an open and inquisitive mind, acknowledging that doubt can never be
fully excluded, even for well-established knowledge claims like thoroughly tested scientific theories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Empiricism and Rationalism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate between empiricism and rationalism centers on the origins of human knowledge. Empiricism emphasizes that
sense experience is the primary source of all knowledge. Some empiricists illustrate this view by describing the mind as
a blank slate that only develops ideas about the external world through the sense data received from the sensory organs.
According to them, the mind can attain various additional insights by comparing impressions, combining them,
generalizing to form more abstract ideas, and deducing new conclusions from them. Empiricists say that all these mental
operations depend on sensory material and do not function on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though rationalists usually accept sense experience as one source of knowledge, they argue that certain forms of
knowledge are directly accessed through reason without sense experience, like knowledge of mathematical and logical
truths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many introductions to the topic begin with a consideration of what metaphysics is and how its truths can be known. But
this itself is one of the most difficult and contentious questions, and the reader could quickly become bogged down and
lose interest. This section is therefore written back to front. The question of what metaphysics is and how it is
justified will be left to the very last. We start by doing some metaphysics: considering some seemingly simple little
questions but which concern the fundamental nature of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/strong&gt; is the study of the most general features of reality, such as existence, objects and their properties,
wholes and their parts, space and time, events, and causation. Metaphysicians attempt to answer basic questions
including &quot;Why is there something rather than nothing?&quot;; &quot;Of what does reality ultimately consist?&quot;; and &quot;Are humans
free?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[The Fundamental Question of Metaphysics]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there anything at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there something rather than nothing?&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; is a question about the reason
for basic existence which has been raised or commented on by a range of philosophers and physicists who called it &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_is_there_anything_at_all%3F&quot;&gt;the
fundamental question of metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metaphysics encompasses a wide range of general and abstract topics. It investigates the nature of existence, the
features all entities have in common, and their division into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_(Aristotle)&quot;&gt;categories of being&lt;/a&gt;. An influential division is between &lt;em&gt;particulars&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;universals&lt;/em&gt;. Particulars are individual unique entities, like a specific apple. Universals are general features that
different particulars have in common, like the color red. Metaphysicians also explore the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_space_and_time&quot;&gt;concepts of space, time, and
change&lt;/a&gt;, and their connection to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.qubitpi.org/posts/causality/&quot;&gt;causality&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_laws&quot;&gt;laws of
nature&lt;/a&gt;. Other topics include how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem&quot;&gt;mind and matter are
related&lt;/a&gt;, whether everything in the world is predetermined, and whether there is free will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important area in metaphysics is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology&quot;&gt;ontology&lt;/a&gt;. Some theorists identify it with general metaphysics. Ontology investigates concepts like &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;becoming&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;. It studies the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_(Aristotle)&quot;&gt;categories of being&lt;/a&gt; and asks what exists on the most fundamental level. Another subfield of metaphysics is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_cosmology&quot;&gt;philosophical cosmology&lt;/a&gt;. It is interested in the essence of the world as a whole. It asks questions including whether the universe has a beginning and an end and whether it was created by something else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key topic in metaphysics concerns the question of whether reality only consists of physical things like matter and energy. Alternative suggestions are that mental entities (such as souls and experiences) and abstract entities (such as numbers) exist apart from physical things. Another topic in metaphysics concerns the problem of identity. One question is how much an entity can change while still remaining the same entity. According to one view, entities have essential and accidental features. They can change their accidental features but they cease to be the same entity if they lose an essential feature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roots of metaphysics lie in antiquity with speculations about the nature and origin of the universe, like those found in the &lt;em&gt;Upanishads&lt;/em&gt; in ancient India, &lt;em&gt;Daoism&lt;/em&gt; in ancient China, and &lt;em&gt;pre-Socratic philosophy&lt;/em&gt; in ancient Greece. During the subsequent medieval period in the West, discussions about the nature of universals were influenced by the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. The modern period saw the emergence of various comprehensive systems of metaphysics, many of which embraced idealism. In the 20th century, traditional metaphysics in general and idealism in particular faced various criticisms, which prompted new approaches to metaphysical inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Idealism]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idealism&lt;/strong&gt; in philosophy, also known as philosophical realism or metaphysical idealism, is the set of metaphysical
perspectives asserting that, most fundamentally, reality is equivalent to mind, spirit, or consciousness; that reality
is entirely a mental construct; or that ideas are the highest type of reality or have the greatest claim to being
considered &quot;real&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Deductive Logic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, a variety of systems of deductive logic have been developed. One of the oldest is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid&apos;s Elements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the axiomatization of plane geometry developed
around 300 BCE in classical Greece. All of the truths or theorems of plane geometry can be derived from the &lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt;
fundamental assumptions or axioms of Euclid&apos;s system. Many have attempted to axiomatize other areas of knowledge,
including many of the sciences and many areas of mathematics. For example,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetices_principia,_nova_methodo_exposita&quot;&gt;Giuseppe Peano successfully axiomatized arithmetic in 1889&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[The Five Fundamental Axioms of Euclid&apos;s Elements]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;greek-text&quot;&amp;gt;᾿Ηιτήσθω ἀπὸ παντὸς σημείου ἐπὶ πᾶν σημεῖον εὐθεῖαν γραμμὴν ἀγαγεῖν.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;greek-text&quot;&amp;gt;Καὶ πεπερασμένην εὐθεῖαν κατὰ τὸ συνεχὲς ἐπ᾿ εὐθείας ἐκβαλεῖν.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;greek-text&quot;&amp;gt;Καὶ παντὶ κέντρῳ καὶ διαστήματι κύκλον γράφεσθαι.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;greek-text&quot;&amp;gt;Καὶ πάσας τὰς ὀρθὰς γωνίας ἴσας ἀλλήλαις εἶναι.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;greek-text&quot;&amp;gt;Καὶ ἐὰν εἰς δύο εὐθείας εὐθεῖα ἐμπίπτουσα τὰς ἐντὸς καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ αὐτὰ μέρη γωνίας δύο ὀρθῶν

ἐλάσσονες.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; [^2]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the theorems appearing in the Elements were not discovered by Euclid himself, but were the work of earlier Greek
mathematicians such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras&quot;&gt;Pythagoras&lt;/a&gt; (and his school),
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates_of_Chios&quot;&gt;Hippocrates of Chios&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theaetetus_(mathematician)&quot;&gt;Theaetetus of Athens&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus&quot;&gt;Eudoxus of Cnidos&lt;/a&gt;. However, Euclid is generally credited with
arranging these theorems in a logical manner.[^2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Ancient Greek text of Euclid&apos;s Elements can be found at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying deductive logic by learning to symbolize natural language sentences (such as English sentences) in a formal
language, one becomes more aware and more appreciative of the importance of the structure and complexities of natural
languages. The specific words that we use have a direct bearing on whether a piece of reasoning is valid or invalid. For
example, it is essential to distinguish between &quot;Roberta will pass if she completes all the homework&quot; and &quot;Roberta will
pass only if she completes all the homework&quot; if we want to reason well about Roberta&apos;s prospects for passing. Finally,
the concepts that we explore here are abstract concepts. Learning to think about abstract concepts and the relations
between them is an important skill that is useful in a wide range of theoretical and applied disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&apos;s explore the core concepts of deductive logic, starting with basic definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Definitions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;argument&lt;/strong&gt; is a set of two or more sentences, one of which is designated as the conclusion and the others as the
&lt;em&gt;premises&lt;/em&gt; (English sentences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An argument is &lt;strong&gt;logically valid&lt;/strong&gt; if and only if it is not possible for all the premises to be true and the
conclusion false. An argument is &lt;em&gt;logically invalid&lt;/em&gt; if and only if it is not logically valid. In this sense, a
logically valid argument is &lt;strong&gt;truth-preserving&lt;/strong&gt; (always taking one from truth to another truth, never falsehood)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Corollary]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An argument whose conclusion is logically true is logically valid no matter what premises it has, because it will
never lead us from truths to a falsehood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An argument is &lt;strong&gt;logically sound&lt;/strong&gt; if and only if it is logically valid and all of its premises are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sentence is &lt;strong&gt;logically true&lt;/strong&gt; if and only if it is not possible for the sentence to be false&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sentence is &lt;strong&gt;logically false&lt;/strong&gt; if and only if it is not possible for the sentence to be true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sentence is &lt;strong&gt;logically indeterminate&lt;/strong&gt; if and only if it is neither logically true nor logically false&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentences &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;Logically equivalent&lt;/strong&gt; if and only if it is not possible for one of these sentences to be
true while the other sentence is false&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Corollary]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All logically true sentences are logically equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All logically false sentences are logically equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of sentences is &lt;strong&gt;logically consistence&lt;/strong&gt; if and only if it is possible for all the members of that set to be
true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Corollary]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An argument whose premises form logically inconsistent sets is logically valid but never logically sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of sentences &lt;strong&gt;logically entails&lt;/strong&gt; a sentence if and only if it is impossible for the members of the set to be
true and that sentence false&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Corollary]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every logically true sentence is entailed by every set of sentences, including the empty set, because it is not
possible for the sentence to be false&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Syntax (of Sentential Logic)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;syntax&lt;/strong&gt; of a language specifies the basic expressions of a language and the rules that determine which
combinations of those expressions count as sentences of the language. The syntax of a language does not specify how the
sentences of the language are to be interpreted; that is a matter for &lt;a href=&quot;#semantics-of-sentential-logic&quot;&gt;semantics&lt;/a&gt;. The
syntax of English, and every other natural language, is enormously complex. Fortunately, the syntax of Sentential Logic
is simple, straightforward, and easily learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we use a language to talk about a language, we are using that language as a &lt;strong&gt;metalanguage&lt;/strong&gt;, and the language that
we are talking about is the &lt;strong&gt;object language&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, in a German class the instructor uses English to talk
about German, and in this instance English is the metalanguage and German is the object language. When a grammar
instructor uses English to talk about the rules of English grammar English is both the metalanguage and the object
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note[Convention]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use the boldface &lt;em&gt;capital&lt;/em&gt; letters &quot;$\boldsymbol{P}$&quot;, &quot;$\boldsymbol{Q}$&quot;, &quot;$\boldsymbol{R}$&quot;,
&quot;$\boldsymbol{S}$&quot; with or without subscripts as in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\boldsymbol{P} \boldsymbol{P_1} \boldsymbol{Q_3}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as &lt;strong&gt;metavariables&lt;/strong&gt; ranging over expressions of object language. These variables are termed &quot;meta&quot; because they are
part of the metalanguage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now begin introducing formal language of Sentential Logic (&lt;strong&gt;SL&lt;/strong&gt;), starting with the specification of the syntax of
SL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sentence Letters&lt;/strong&gt;: the capital Roman letters &apos;A&apos; through &apos;Z&apos;, with or without positive integer subscripts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both are denoted by capital letters, expressions (bolded such as $\boldsymbol{P}$) and sentences (regular
like $P$) are not the same. Expressions can be a sentences but not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sentential Connectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\thicksim$ (Negation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&amp;amp;$ (Conjunction) - In $(\boldsymbol{P} &amp;amp; \boldsymbol{Q})$, $\boldsymbol{P}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ are called
&lt;strong&gt;conjuncts&lt;/strong&gt; of the conjunction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\vee$ (Disjunction) - In $(\boldsymbol{P} \vee \boldsymbol{Q})$, $\boldsymbol{P}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ are called
&lt;strong&gt;disjuncts&lt;/strong&gt; of the conjunction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\supset$ (Material Conditionals) - In $(\boldsymbol{P} \supset \boldsymbol{Q})$,$\boldsymbol{P}$ is called
&lt;strong&gt;antecedent&lt;/strong&gt; and $\boldsymbol{P}$ &lt;strong&gt;consequent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\equiv$ (Material Biconditionals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sentence of SL&lt;/strong&gt;, the definition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every sentence letter of SL is a sentence of SL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $\boldsymbol{P}$ is a sentence of SL, then $\boldsymbol{\thicksim P}$ is a sentence of SL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $\boldsymbol{P}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ are sentences of SL, then $(\boldsymbol{P} &amp;amp; \boldsymbol{Q})$ is a
sentence of SL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $\boldsymbol{P}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ are sentences of SL, then $(\boldsymbol{P} \vee \boldsymbol{Q})$ is a
sentence of SL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $\boldsymbol{P}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ are sentences of SL, then $(\boldsymbol{P} \supset \boldsymbol{Q})$ is a
sentence of SL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $\boldsymbol{P}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ are sentences of SL, then $(\boldsymbol{P} \equiv \boldsymbol{Q})$ is a
sentence of SL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing is a sentence of SL unless it can be formed by repeated application of 1 - 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::warning[The followings are not sentences of SL, although they look like very much are]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$B\ &amp;amp;\ D$ - no parenthesis as definition 3 above requires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\vee A$ - no left operand as definition 4 requires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$(BC \supset D)$ - $BC$ is not a sentence by definition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$(B \subset (C \vee D))$ - $\subset$ is not a symbol of SL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$(\boldsymbol{P} \equiv \boldsymbol{Q})$ - neither $\boldsymbol{P}$ nor $\boldsymbol{Q}$ is a sentence of SL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Semantics (of Sentential Logic)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determinism is a philosophical concept that addresses the nature of causality and its implications for the universe and
our place within it. At its core, determinism is the belief that all events, including human actions, are ultimately
determined by causes external to the will. In other words, for every event that occurs, there are conditions that could
not have caused any other event. This idea has profound implications for our understanding of free will, morality, and
the very nature of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different types of determinism, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard Determinism&lt;/strong&gt;: This view asserts that every event, including human decisions, is completely caused by prior
events and cannot be influenced by free will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soft Determinism&lt;/strong&gt;: This position suggests that while our choices may not be entirely determined, they are still
the result of a complex interplay of causes and conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibilist Determinism&lt;/strong&gt;: This view argues that free will and determinism are compatible, meaning that it is
possible to have free will without being completely controlled by prior events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kant on Determinism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immanuel Kant&apos;s position on determinism is complex and nuanced. He was neither a strict determinist nor a simple
libertarian, but a compatibilist of a unique kind. He grappled deeply with the apparent contradiction between determinism and
free will, proposing a sophisticated solution known as his &lt;strong&gt;two-standpoint theory&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determinism in the Phenomenal World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kant argued that as far as the world of appearances (the phenomenal world) is concerned, everything is subject to
the laws of cause and effect. This is the world we experience through our senses and which science investigates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a scientific or empirical perspective, human actions, like all other events, can be understood as determined by
prior causes (our empirical character, circumstances, psychological drives, etc.). So, in this sense, when we view
ourselves or others as objects in the empirical world, our actions appear to be determined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freedom in the Noumenal World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, Kant also posited a noumenal world (the world of &quot;things-in-themselves&quot;), which lies beyond our sensory
experience and is accessible only through reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this noumenal realm, he argued that human beings possess transcendental freedom. This is a different kind of
causality - a causality of reason itself, unconditioned by prior empirical causes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Kant, this freedom is not something we can empirically prove or know in the same way we know scientific laws.
Instead, it&apos;s a postulate of practical reason, meaning we must assume it to be true in order for morality and moral
responsibility to make sense. If we weren&apos;t truly free to choose our actions, then holding people accountable for
them (praise or blame) would be meaningless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kant explicitly addressed the apparent conflict between determinism and freedom as one of his &quot;Antinomies of Pure
Reason&quot; in the &lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;. An &lt;strong&gt;antinomy&lt;/strong&gt; is a pair of seemingly contradictory but equally defensible
propositions. He argued that the contradiction arises from trying to apply categories of understanding (like causality)
beyond their proper domain (the phenomenal world) to the noumenal world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, Kant holds that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our actions, as phenomena, are indeed determined by natural laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, we are also free as noumenal beings, capable of acting from reason and moral duty, independent of empirical
influences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &quot;two-standpoint&quot; approach allows him to affirm the validity of scientific determinism while simultaneously
preserving the possibility of moral responsibility and human freedom. While it&apos;s a profound and influential solution, it
has also been a subject of extensive debate and interpretation among philosophers ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core ideas regarding Kant&apos;s two-standpoint theory concerning freedom and determinism are primarily discussed in his
most significant work on theoretical philosophy - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the foundational text where Kant lays
out his transcendental idealism, the distinction between the phenomenal (appearances) and noumenal
(things-in-themselves) worlds. In the &lt;strong&gt;Third Antinomy of Pure Reason&lt;/strong&gt;, within the &quot;Transcendental Dialectic&quot; section,
Kant explicitly sets up the apparent contradiction between &quot;causality according to the laws of nature&quot; (determinism) and
&quot;causality through freedom.&quot; He then resolves this antinomy by introducing his two-standpoint solution: that we are
determined as phenomena in the empirical world but free as noumena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Newtonian Mechanics and General Relativity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determinism in the West is often associated with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics&quot;&gt;Newtonian mechanics/physics&lt;/a&gt;, which depicts the physical matter of
the universe as operating according to a set of fixed laws. The &quot;billiard ball&quot; hypothesis, a product of Newtonian
physics, argues that once the initial conditions of the universe have been established, the rest of the history of the
universe follows inevitably. If it were actually possible to have complete knowledge of physical matter and all of the
laws governing that matter at any one time, then it would be theoretically possible to compute the time and place of
every event that will ever occur (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon&quot;&gt;Laplace&apos;s demon&lt;/a&gt;). In this sense,
the basic particles of the universe operate in the same fashion as the rolling balls on a billiard table, moving and
striking each other in predictable ways to produce predictable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not it is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian mechanics deals only with caused events; for example, if an
object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed
straight toward another predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one&apos;s
measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other
fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will
always bring one&apos;s observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an
ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been successful. But &lt;strong&gt;it fails as velocities become some substantial
fraction of the speed of light and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied&lt;/strong&gt;. Before the discovery of
quantum effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, &quot;uncertainty&quot; was always a term that applied to the accuracy
of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newtonian mechanics, as well as any following physical theories, are results of observations and experiments, and so
they describe &quot;how it all works&quot; within a tolerance. However, old western scientists believed if there are any logical
connections found between an observed cause and effect, there must be also some absolute natural laws behind. Belief in
perfect natural laws driving everything, instead of just describing what we should expect, led to searching for a set of
universal simple laws that rule the world. This movement significantly encouraged deterministic views in Western
philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are discussions about determinism in the context of General Relativity (&lt;strong&gt;GR&lt;/strong&gt;). While GR itself is a
deterministic theory, its predictions and implications have been subject to interpretations that touch on the nature
of determinism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In classical GR, the Einstein Field Equations describe how mass and energy warp spacetime, leading to gravitational
fields. The equations are deterministic, meaning that if we know the initial conditions (e.g., the distribution of
matter and energy) and follow them carefully, we can predict the entire evolution of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some aspects of GR have led to discussions about determinism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Conditions and Determinacy&lt;/strong&gt;: In classical GR, the initial conditions are crucial in determining the fate
of a system. However, the theory&apos;s deterministic nature raises questions about the role of quantum fluctuations or
other non-deterministic influences on the initial conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Hole Information Paradox&lt;/strong&gt;: The paradox highlights the apparent loss of information when matter falls into a
black hole. Some interpretations, such as Hawking&apos;s black hole complementarity, suggest that information is preserved
in a way that&apos;s still deterministic, while others propose that it&apos;s encoded in quantum states or other
non-deterministic frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Gravity and Determinism&lt;/strong&gt;: The development of quantum gravity theories, such as loop quantum gravity (LQG)
or string theory, aims to merge GR with quantum mechanics. In these approaches, determinism is often compromised due
to the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT)&lt;/strong&gt;: CDT is a quantum gravity theory that uses a discretized spacetime, similar
to LQG. It has been shown to be a deterministic theory, but its predictive power and fundamental laws are still
being explored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relational Quantum Mechanics&lt;/strong&gt;: This approach posits that reality arises from the relationships between observers
and the physical world. In this framework, determinism is not necessarily tied to a fixed set of initial conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While GR itself is generally considered deterministic, its extensions, interpretations, and potential mergers with
quantum mechanics have led to debates about determinism in these contexts. The discussions continue to be an active area
of research, with ongoing efforts to reconcile the principles of GR with the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quantum Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Quantum Mechanics, &lt;a href=&quot;#newtonian-mechanics-and-general-relativity&quot;&gt;Newtonian physics&lt;/a&gt; dominated. Modern quantum
mechanics, however, casts reasonable doubt on this main thesis of determinism. Quantum mechanics is the product of a
careful application of the scientific method, logic and empiricism. Through a large number of careful experiments
physicists developed a rather unintuitive mental model: A particle&apos;s path cannot be specified in from its quantum
description. &quot;Path&quot; is a classical, practical attribute in everyday life, but one that quantum particles do not possess.
Quantum mechanics attributes probability to all possible paths and asserts the only one outcome will be observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/feynman-paths.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The randomness in quantum mechanics derives from the quantum aspect of the model. Different experimental results are
obtained for eachook  individual quanta. Some (including Albert Einstein) have argued that the inability to predict any more
than probabilities is simply due to ignorance. The idea is that, beyond the conditions and laws can be observed or
deduced, there are also hidden factors or &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory&quot;&gt;hidden variables&lt;/a&gt;&quot;
that determine absolutely in which order photons reach the detector screen. They argue that the course of the universe
is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors. So, they say, it
only appears that things proceed in a probabilistic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein insisted that, &quot;&lt;em&gt;I am convinced God does not play dice&lt;/em&gt;&quot; in a private letter to Max Born, 4 December
1926&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is an overview of the Cause and Effect as the Principle of Causality, establishing one event or action as
the direct result of another, from the following 4 perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kant&apos;s Metaphysics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as metaphysics. Kant primarily discusses the concept of
cause and effect in the &lt;strong&gt;Division One - Book II - Section III - 3.B. Second
analogy of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.qubitpi.org/posts/kritik-der-reinen-vernunft/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought that time and space
were notions prior to human understanding of the progress or evolution of the world, and he also recognized the priority
of causality. But he did not have the understanding that came with knowledge of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space#Causal_structure&quot;&gt;Minkowski geometry&lt;/a&gt; and the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/QubitPi/general-relativity&quot;&gt;Special Theory of Relativity&lt;/a&gt;, that the notion of causality can be used as a prior foundation from which to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_structure&quot;&gt;construct notions&lt;/a&gt; of time and space[^1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aristotle&apos;s (Western) Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Book II, Chapter 3 of his work &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/c/fIM7TADB&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Aristotle considered in how many
senses &quot;because&quot; may answer the question &quot;why&quot;. He believes understanding a thing means knowing its &quot;how and why&quot; and
gave the following rough classification of the causal determinants of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[The meaning of physics in Aristotle]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Physics&lt;/em&gt; deals with the most general (philosophical) principles of natural or moving things, both living
and non-living, rather than physical theories (in the modern sense) or investigations of the particular contents of the
universe. The chief purpose of the work is to discover the principles and causes of change, or movement, or motion,
especially that of natural wholes (mostly living things, but also inanimate wholes like the cosmos).[^2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the &quot;&lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt;&quot; in the discussion below is nothing but just the movement of a thing from one place to another,
such as a vehicle head toward San Francisco from Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Material Cause&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The existence of material for the generating process to start from&lt;/em&gt;. For example, bronze &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;
the statue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Formal Cause&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The material must receives the form (characteristics) of the type which conforms to its own
definition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Efficient Cause&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;There must be something to initiate a process for change and cease the process when completed&lt;/em&gt;,
i.e. changing from what it was to what it is to be. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/c/V3QZplQN&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lloyd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, of the
four causes, only this one is what is meant by the modern English word &quot;cause&quot; in ordinary speech[^1].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Cause&lt;/em&gt; - The &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; or purpose of the process being initiated. For instance, people exercise for their health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, several of the 4 coalesce one another to produce a single effect and the same cause is often alleged for its
opposite effects. For instance if the pilot&apos;s presence would have brought the ship safe to harbour, we say that he
caused its wreck by his absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, none of them are the causes or effects of others. For example, we may say that a man is in fine condition
because he has been in training, or that he has been in training because of the good condition he expected as the
result. But one is the cause as aim (Final Cause) and the other as initiating the process (Efficient Cause).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;chinese-text&quot;&amp;gt;中国阴阳学说&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;chinese-text&quot;&amp;gt;春秋战国末期，观星学有了很大的发展，对后世产生了很深远的影响。人们将星象分门别类，用星象“感应”来描述世间的种种现象
（Theory of causality）。其中 &lt;strong&gt;《吕氏春秋》&lt;/strong&gt; 中的一段文字对此有代表性的描述:&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note[《吕氏春秋》，有始览第一，应同篇]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;chinese-text&quot;&amp;gt;类固相召，气同则合，声比则应。鼓宫而宫动，鼓角而角动。平地注水，水流湿；均薪施火，火就燥；

众人以为命，安知其所？&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;[^3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;chinese-text&quot;&amp;gt;除此之外，世间万物亦可划分以阴阳、五行、以及 &lt;strong&gt;《易经》&lt;/strong&gt; 中的八卦。&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Buddhist Philosophy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma&quot;&gt;Karma&lt;/a&gt; (Sanskrit: &lt;em&gt;कर्म&lt;/em&gt;) is the causality principle focusing on 1) causes, 2)
actions, 3) effects, where it is the mind&apos;s phenomena that guide the actions that the actor performs. Buddhism trains 3)
the actor&apos;s actions for continued and uncontrived virtuous outcomes aimed at reducing suffering. This follows the 4)
&lt;em&gt;Subject-verb-object&lt;/em&gt; structure[^1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the classic Buddhist schools teach Karma. &quot;The law of karma is a special instance of the law of cause and effect,
according to which all our actions of body, speech, and mind are causes and all our experiences are their effects.&quot;[^1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme to theories of karma is its principle of causality. This relationship between karma and causality is a
central motif in all schools of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain thought. One of the earliest associations of karma to
causality occurs in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihadaranyaka_Upanishad&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; verses
4.4.5 - 6:[^4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as a man is like this or like that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here they say that a person consists of desires,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and as is his desire, so is his will;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and as is his will, so is his deed;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and whatever deed he does, that he will reap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Karma&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;chinese-text&quot;&amp;gt;的最好中文翻译是“业”（既“业障”的业）。玩原神的朋友，
这和&lt;a href=&quot;https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Nahida&quot;&gt;纳西妲的元素战技“灭净三业”&lt;/a&gt;中的“业”是一个意思&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;（&amp;lt;span class=&quot;chinese-text&quot;&amp;gt;三业&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; = Tri-Karma）
&lt;img src=&quot;./nahida.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Taoism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karma is an important concept in Taoism. Every deed is tracked by deities and spirits. Appropriate rewards or
retribution follow karma, just like a shadow follows a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; state of the art in Philosophy (particularly in Kant) and Science (GR &amp;amp; Quantum) seem to suggest that our
reality would be neither deterministic or non-deterministic but a mix or a new concept that human has yet to discover.&lt;/p&gt;

notable precursor to those of Ernst Mach and Albert Einstein. Interest in Berkeley&apos;s ideas and works increased greatly
after World War II because they tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century,

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy of Berkeley&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Berkeley (1685–1753) was an Anglo-Irish philosopher and Anglican bishop who is best known for his radical
philosophical position of &lt;strong&gt;immaterialism&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as &lt;strong&gt;subjective idealism&lt;/strong&gt;. His most famous dictum,
&quot;Esse est percipi&quot; (to be is to be perceived), encapsulates the core of his thought. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejection of Material Substance:&lt;/strong&gt; Berkeley fundamentally denied the existence of matter, or mind-independent
material substance. He argued that there is no &quot;stuff&quot; or substratum that exists independently of a perceiving mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality as Ideas:&lt;/strong&gt; For Berkeley, everything that exists is either a mind (a &quot;spirit&quot;) or an &quot;idea&quot; in a mind.
Physical objects, such as trees, houses, or tables, are not external material things but rather collections of ideas
or sensations perceived by a mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Perception:&lt;/strong&gt; We do not perceive an external material world that &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; our ideas. Instead, we directly
perceive ideas. When you see a red apple, the redness, the shape, the taste, the smell - these are all ideas in our
mind. There is no underlying material &quot;apple&quot; that exists apart from these perceived qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &quot;to be is to be perceived,&quot; what happens to objects when no human mind is perceiving them (e.g., a tree in an
uninhabited forest)? Berkeley&apos;s answer is that &lt;strong&gt;God, as an infinite and omnipresent mind, perceives everything
continuously&lt;/strong&gt;. This divine perception ensures the consistent and orderly existence of the world, even when individual
finite minds are not attending to it. God, according to Berkeley, is also the ultimate source of our sensory ideas. The
regularities and patterns we observe in nature are a result of God&apos;s consistent will and the orderly way in which the
God impresses ideas upon our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkeley&apos;s ideas had a significant impact on subsequent philosophers, particularly David Hume, who pushed empiricism to
its skeptical limits, and later idealists like &lt;strong&gt;Immanuel Kant&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;German Idealists&lt;/strong&gt;. While often criticized for
its counter-intuitive nature, Berkeley&apos;s work &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; philosophers to seriously consider the nature of perception,
reality, and the relationship between mind and world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#berkeley-on-mathematics&quot;&gt;Berkeley also engaged with the science of his day&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that scientific laws describe the
regularities among our ideas, not inherent properties of a material world. He viewed causation not as one material
object &quot;making&quot; another happen, but as a consistent sequence of ideas, ordained by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Berkeley on Mathematics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all treatises written on the subject in the eighteenth century, Berkeley&apos;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/worksofgeorgeber03berk_0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analyst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the most sustained and penetrating critique of the methodology of
the infinitesimal calculus. This work foreshadows the foundational research of the nineteenth century, and provides a
link between the mathematical preoccupations of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and those of the nineteenth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, the mathematicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries - and in particular Newton, Leibniz,
and Euler - had been more concerned with exploiting and extending the techniques of the differential and integral
calculus than with tidying its foundations. The mathematicians of the early nineteenth century, in contrast, bent their
efforts towards placing the calculus on an unobjectionable footing - towards chasing away the obscurities that
surrounded such notions as &lt;em&gt;infinitesimal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;differential&lt;/em&gt;. This project was pursued during the first
two-thirds of the nineteenth century by such mathematicians as Gauss, Bolzano, Cauchy, Abel, Fourier, Riemann, and
Weierstrass. Their investigations into the foundations of real analysis in turn inspired the later studies by Dedekind,
Cantor, Frege, Peano, Peirce, Russell, and Hilbert of set-theory, logic, and the foundations of arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkeley&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/worksofgeorgeber03berk_0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analyst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; prefigures this entire development, and his
philosophically-motivated criticisms of the Newtonian mathematics of the eighteenth century raise many issues that will
loom large in the selections that follow. These issues may be loosely grouped under 4 headings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His critique of &lt;em&gt;infinitesimals&lt;/em&gt; raises not only the issue of justifying the central concepts of the calculus but
also the more general issue of the legitimacy of the &lt;em&gt;actual infinite&lt;/em&gt; in mathematics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berkeley, as befits the empiricist philosopher who wrote &lt;em&gt;An essay towards a new theory of vision&lt;/em&gt;, makes acute
comments about the relationship between geometry, human visual perception, and the foundations of the calculus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In numerous places Berkeley discusses the problem of the &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt; of mathematical expressions; declaring, for
instance, in &lt;em&gt;Of infinites&lt;/em&gt;, that &quot;This plain to me we ought to use no sign without an idea answering to it&quot;; &lt;strong&gt;one
of his cardinal criticisms of Newton is that infinitesimals can have no empirical reference&lt;/strong&gt;. This topic of the
reference of mathematical expressions (a topic on which Berkeley occasionally shifted his position) was to be central
to the development of algebra during the nineteenth century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All these mathematical issues - in analysis, geometry, and algebra - are intertwined in Berkeley&apos;s thought with more
general concerns about mathematical truth, the rigour of demonstrations, the applicability of mathematics to the
empirical world, and the scope and limits of mathematical knowledge. Philosophers more often react to developments in
mathematics than anticipate them, and in modern times perhaps only Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant can be said to have
equalled Berkeley&apos;s insight into the foundations of mathematics .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between Berkeley&apos;s mathematical interests and the leading strands of his philosophy was not adventitious:
his education at Trinity College, Dublin was in mathematics and logic as well as in philosophy and the classics, and the
foundations of mathematics was to be a lifelong preoccupation. His investigations into the philosophy of mathematics
commenced with his first published work (in effect, his bachelor&apos;s thesis), the &lt;em&gt;Arithmetica et miscellanea
mathematica&lt;/em&gt;; they were continued in his early, unpublished Philosophical commentaries and &lt;em&gt;Of infinites&lt;/em&gt; - especially
in &lt;em&gt;Notebook B of the Commentaries&lt;/em&gt;, where remarks on optics and on the nature of the soul mingle with observations on
algebra, geometry, and the infinitesimal calculus; they play a major though subsidiary role in his &lt;em&gt;Principles of human
knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;De motu&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Alciphron&lt;/em&gt;; and they are once more the centre of attention in his last major philosophical
enterprise, the critique of Newton and the Newtonians in &lt;em&gt;The analyst&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berkeley&apos;s writings show the futility of attempting to draw a sharp boundary between philosophy and mathematics&lt;/strong&gt;. We
have already observed that his philosophical reflections led him to deep criticisms of current mathematical practice.
But the influence goes in the other direction as well, and his study of mathematics and the physical sciences affected
his general metaphysical position—so much so that the two are often difficult to disentangle. His discussions of
infinitesimals are interwoven with arguments about &lt;em&gt;minima sensibilia&lt;/em&gt; and with his doctrine that, for sensible objects,
&lt;em&gt;esse is percipi&lt;/em&gt;; his discussion in the &lt;em&gt;Principles of human knowledge&lt;/em&gt; of algebra and of geometric reasoning is bound
up with his view of language and his rejection of abstract ideas; his critique of the foundations of the calculus is
motivated by many of the same epistemological considerations that underlie his critique of the idea of material
substance. It is these connections (rather than his powerful but already-known logical criticisms of Newton&apos;s reasoning
in the &lt;em&gt;Principia&lt;/em&gt;) that give his philosophy of mathematics its depth and its strength and its present interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the penetration of his writings—their wealth of implications both for mathematics and for philosophy - Berkeley
had little actual influence on the development of mathematics. He was nobody&apos;s inspiration, and indeed to this day is
rarely thought of as a philosopher of mathematics at all. The nineteenth century remembered him principally as an
ingenious paradoxer, the precursor of Hume who had denied the existence of material substance; his writings on
mathematics have largely been forgotten. (Two exceptions are reproduced below: &lt;em&gt;MacLaurin&lt;/em&gt; and the correspondence
between William Rowan Hamilton and Augustus De Morgan.) But even if Berkeley did not himself initiate or influence the
great period of nineteenth-century foundational research, he nevertheless glimpsed many of its central themes; and his
writings are therefore an appropriate starting-point for these volumes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be continued...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sources for Learning New Features among JDK Release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best sources to learn about new features in each major release of Java JDK are the official Oracle documentation and
resources directly from the Java team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk-relnotes-index.html&quot;&gt;JDK Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;: Oracle publishes
detailed release notes for each JDK version, outlining all changes, including new features, enhancements, API changes,
and deprecated or removed elements. These are the most complete and accurate source of information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://javaalmanac.io/&quot;&gt;Java Version Almanac&lt;/a&gt;: This independent resource provides a comprehensive comparison of Java
versions and lists of changes, including added or removed methods and APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inside.java/&quot;&gt;inside.java&lt;/a&gt;: This Oracle portal offers news, views, podcasts, and newscasts directly from the
Java Team at Oracle, often providing deeper dives into new features and their implications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JDK 9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Serialization Filter Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/9-relnotes.html#JDK-8155760&quot;&gt;JDK 9 Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Serialization Filtering introduces a new mechanism which allows incoming streams of object-serialization data to be
filtered in order to improve both security and robustness. Every ObjectInputStream applies a filter, if configured, to
the stream contents during deserialization. Filters are set using either a system property or a configured security
property. The value of the &quot;jdk.serialFilter&quot; patterns are described in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/290&quot;&gt;JEP 290 Serialization Filtering&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;JRE&amp;gt;/lib/security/java.security&lt;/code&gt;. Filter
actions are logged to the &apos;java.io.serialization&apos; logger, if enabled.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JEP 290 introduced serialization filtering to Java, allowing control over which classes can be deserialized from an
&lt;code&gt;ObjectInputStream&lt;/code&gt;. As an example, suppose we have 2 serializable classes: &lt;strong&gt;AllowedClass&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;RestrictedClass&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package com.example.allowed;

import java.io.Serial;
import java.io.Serializable;

public class AllowedClass implements Serializable {
    @Serial private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    public String message;

    public AllowedClass(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return &quot;AllowedClass: &quot; + message;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package com.example.restricted;

import java.io.Serial;
import java.io.Serializable;

public class RestrictedClass implements Serializable {
    @Serial private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    public String secret;

    public RestrictedClass(String secret) {
        this.secret = secret;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return &quot;RestrictedClass: &quot; + secret;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure &lt;code&gt;AllowedClass&lt;/code&gt; can be deserialized while &lt;code&gt;RestrictedClass&lt;/code&gt; cannot, we can use either
&lt;a href=&quot;#pattern-based-filter-system-property-example&quot;&gt;pattern-based filters defined via system properties&lt;/a&gt; or security
properties, or &lt;a href=&quot;#programmatic-filter-objectinputfilter-api&quot;&gt;programmatically using the &lt;code&gt;ObjectInputFilter&lt;/code&gt; API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pattern-Based Filter (System Property Example)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example demonstrates how to set a global filter using the &lt;code&gt;jdk.serialFilter&lt;/code&gt; system property to allow only classes
within &lt;code&gt;com.example.allowed&lt;/code&gt; and reject all others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the JDK system property has been set with &lt;code&gt;-Djdk.serialFilter=&quot;com.example.allowed.*;!*&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, the following runtime
should execute successfully without error for &lt;code&gt;AllowedClass&lt;/code&gt; and throw exception for &lt;code&gt;RestrictedClass&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.Serializable;

public static void serialize(Serializable obj, Class&amp;lt;? extends Serializable&amp;gt; clazz) {
    try (ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(bos)) {
        oos.writeObject(obj);

        try (ByteArrayInputStream bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(bos.toByteArray());
             ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bis)) {
            Serializable result = clazz.cast(ois.readObject());
        }
    } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException exception) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(exception);
    }
}

AllowedClass allowed = new AllowedClass(&quot;Hello Allowed!&quot;);
RestrictedClass restricted = new RestrictedClass(&quot;Secret Data!&quot;);

serialize(allowed, AllowedClass.class);       // ✅
serialize(restricted, RestrictedClass.class); // ❌ runtime error
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Programmatic Filter (ObjectInputFilter API)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example shows how to set a filter directly on an &lt;code&gt;ObjectInputStream&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;ObjectInputFilter&lt;/code&gt; interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.ObjectInputFilter;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.Serializable;

public static void serialize(Serializable obj, Class&amp;lt;? extends Serializable&amp;gt; clazz) {
    try (ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(bos)) {
        oos.writeObject(obj);

        try (ByteArrayInputStream bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(bos.toByteArray());
             ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bis)) {

            ois.setObjectInputFilter(info -&amp;gt; {
                if (info.serialClass() != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; info.serialClass().getName().startsWith(&quot;com.example.allowed&quot;)) {
                    return ObjectInputFilter.Status.ALLOWED;
                }
                return ObjectInputFilter.Status.REJECTED;
            });

            Serializable result = clazz.cast(ois.readObject());
        }
    } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException exception) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(exception);
    }
}

AllowedClass allowed = new AllowedClass(&quot;Hello Allowed!&quot;);
RestrictedClass restricted = new RestrictedClass(&quot;Secret Data!&quot;);

serialize(allowed, AllowedClass.class);       // ✅
serialize(restricted, RestrictedClass.class); // ❌ runtime error
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the &lt;code&gt;setObjectInputFilter&lt;/code&gt; method is used on the &lt;code&gt;ObjectInputStream&lt;/code&gt; to apply a lambda expression as
the filter. This filter explicitly allows classes starting with &lt;code&gt;com.example.allowed&lt;/code&gt; and rejects all others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Compact Strings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/9-relnotes.html#JDK-8054307&quot;&gt;JDK 9 Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;In JDK 9 the internal character storage of the &lt;code&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;StringBuffer&lt;/code&gt; classes has been
changed from a UTF-16 char array to a byte array plus a one-byte encoding-flag field. The new storage representation
stores/encodes the characters either as ISO-8859-1/Latin-1 (one byte per character), or as UTF-16 (two bytes per
character), based upon the contents of the string. The newly added encoding flag field indicates which encoding is used.
This feature reduces, by 50%, the amount of space required for String objects to store the characters if the String
object only contains single-byte/ latin-1 characters.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before compact strings, Java&apos;s &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; class stored characters in a &lt;code&gt;char[]&lt;/code&gt; array, where each &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; is 2 bytes
(UTF-16 encoding). This meant that even strings containing only ASCII characters (which could be represented by 1 byte)
would still consume 2 bytes per character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://openjdk.org/jeps/254&quot;&gt;JEP 254&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; implementation was changed to use either the old storage
mechanism or a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; array plus an encoding flag. If the string contains only Latin-1 characters (characters with
code points from 0 to 255, fitting within 1 byte), it will be stored as a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; array, effectively using 1 byte per
character. If it contains characters outside of Latin-1 (requiring more than 1 byte), it will revert to the
2-byte-per-character UTF-16 representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compact string optimization is transparent to the developer. We continue to use the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; class as before. The
JVM automatically decides the most memory-efficient internal representation based on the characters present in the
string. This significantly reduces the memory footprint of applications that deal extensively with ASCII or Latin-1
based strings, which is a very common scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ability to Limit the Capacity of Buffers That Can Be Held in the Temporary Buffer Cache&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/9-relnotes.html#JDK-8156802&quot;&gt;JDK 9 Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;The system property &lt;code&gt;jdk.nio.maxCachedBufferSize&lt;/code&gt; has been introduced in JDK 9 to limit the memory used by the
&quot;temporary buffer cache&quot;. The temporary buffer cache is a per-thread cache of direct memory used by the NIO
implementation to support applications that do I/O with buffers backed by arrays in the java heap. The value of the
property is the maximum capacity of a direct buffer that can be cached. If the property is not set then no limit is put
on the size of buffers that are cached. Applications with certain patterns of I/O usage may benefit from using this
property. In particular if an application does I/O with large multi-megabyte buffers at startup but therefore does I/O
with small buffers may see a benefit to using this property. Applications that do I/O using direct buffers will not see
any benefit to using this system property.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Java NIO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding &lt;strong&gt;Java NIO&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;New Input/Output&lt;/strong&gt;) is crucial for building high-performance, scalable applications,
especially those dealing with network communication or large file operations. Introduced in Java 1.4, NIO provides an
alternative and often more efficient way to handle I/O compared to the traditional &lt;code&gt;java.io&lt;/code&gt; package. In particular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-blocking IO&lt;/strong&gt;: Java NIO enables us to do non-blocking IO. For instance, a thread can ask a channel to read data
into a buffer. While the channel reads data into the buffer, the thread can do something else. Once data is read into
the buffer, the thread can then continue processing it. The same is true for writing data to channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channels and Buffers&lt;/strong&gt;: In the standard IO API we work with byte streams and character streams. In NIO we work with
channels and buffers. Data is always read from a channel into a buffer, or written from a buffer to a channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selectors&lt;/strong&gt;: Java NIO contains the concept of &quot;selectors&quot;. A &lt;strong&gt;selector&lt;/strong&gt; is an object that can monitor multiple
channels for events (like: connection opened, data arrived etc.). Thus, a single thread can monitor multiple channels
for data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be continued...)&lt;/p&gt;

</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For those who are getting into DevOps, build a home lab or spin up some servers on a cloud provider like DigitalOcean
for example. Dive into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain/DNS zones, records&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/saidutt46/domain-check&quot;&gt;domain-check&lt;/a&gt; is a good tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load balancers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn some kind of Cloud platform - AWS is most common but GCP and Azure are also sought after. Openstack (&quot;private
cloud&quot; installed on one&apos;s own hardware) is also pretty cool but here be dragons, also it&apos;s rare to see roles looking
for this. The plus side is that if one has hardware to spare then is lots of the same concepts, if not terminology,
apply to public clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand VPC, networking, security at a conceptual level (think medieval fortress, office building security). Brush
up on networking fundamentals. We aren&apos;t looking to be a network engineer but should have some grasp of subnetting so
we can read and write a route table and security groups. This comes up often in Cloud infra. Learn how to troubleshoot
with dig, curl, telnet, netstat, tcpdump, and netcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally some Linux knowledge and bash scripting - but Windows/Powershell is also good to know, especially if looking
into Azure. We want to be able to read and write basic scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use git, or some other version control system. Code has to live somewhere and we want to know how to
clone repositories, branch a repo, and push commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containerization. Start with Docker, basic bash or Python scripting skills and comfort in shell will help immensely
here. Kubernetes is in high demand but we first want to get a grip on containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation. Terraform and Ansible are both super cool but almost distinct languages unto themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins, gitlab-ci, GitHub actions, etc. The principles of continuous integration and continuous
delivery and how that ties into software development. This is the real meat and potatoes of what DevOps traditionally
entails but it depends a lot on all these other pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web API and architecture. Not all but lots of DevOps generally revolves around supporting some kind of web
application. Arguably DevOps exists to support microservices running in some platform (AWS, K8s, etc.) which
traditionally would have been part of a monolithic server architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, check out https://roadmap.sh/devops and https://devops-daily.com/roadmap to see where your gaps are. In addition,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hw.glich.co/&quot;&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource to go with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Continuous Delivery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types - including new features, configuration changes, bug
fixes and experiments - into production, or into the hands of users, &lt;em&gt;safely&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; in a &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt; way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of continuous delivery is to make deployments - whether of a large-scale distributed system, a complex
production environment, an embedded system, or an app - predictable, routine affairs that can be performed on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We achieve all this by ensuring our code is always in a deployable state, even in the face of teams of thousands of
developers making changes on a daily basis. We thus completely eliminate the integration, testing and hardening phases
that traditionally followed &quot;dev complete&quot;, as well as code freezes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Continuous Delivery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often assumed that if we want to deploy software more frequently, we must accept lower levels of stability and
reliability in our systems. In fact, peer-reviewed research shows that this is not the case. High performance teams
consistently deliver services faster and more reliably than their low performing competition. This is true even in
highly regulated domains such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMS97X5ZTGc&quot;&gt;financial services&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwHVlJtqhaI&quot;&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;. This capability provides an incredible competitive advantage
for organizations that are willing to invest the effort to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firms with high-performing IT organizations were twice as likely to exceed their profitability, market share and
productivity goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performers achieved higher levels of both throughput and stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of continuous delivery practices including version control, continuous integration, and test automation
predicts higher IT performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture is measurable and predicts job satisfaction and organizational performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous Delivery measurably reduces both deployment pain and team burnout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practices at the heart of continuous delivery help us achieve several important benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low risk releases&lt;/strong&gt;. The primary goal of continuous delivery is to make software deployments painless, low-risk
events that can be performed at any time, on demand. By applying &lt;a href=&quot;#patterns&quot;&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;blue-green
deployments&lt;/strong&gt; it is relatively straightforward to achieve zero-downtime deployments that are undetectable to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note[Blue-green Deployment]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/blue-green-deployments.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading blue-green-deployments.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges with automating deployment is the cut-over itself, taking software from the final stage of
testing to live production. We usually need to do this quickly in order to minimize downtime. The blue-green
deployment approach does this by ensuring we have &lt;strong&gt;two production environments&lt;/strong&gt;, as identical as possible. At any
time one of them, let&apos;s say blue for the example, is live. As we prepare a new release of our software we do our
final stage of testing in the green environment. Once the software is working in the green environment, we switch the
router so that all incoming requests go to the green environment - the blue one is now idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue-green deployment also gives us a rapid way to rollback - if anything goes wrong we switch the router back to
our blue environment. There&apos;s still the issue of dealing with missed transactions while the green environment was
live, but depending on our design we may be able to feed transactions to both environments in such a way as to keep
the blue environment as a backup when the green is live. Or we may be able to put the application in read-only mode
before cut-over, run it for a while in read-only mode, and then switch it to read-write mode. That may be enough to
flush out many outstanding issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two environments need to be different but as identical as possible. In some situations they can be different
pieces of hardware, or they can be different virtual machines running on the same (or different) hardware. They can
also be a single operating environment partitioned into separate zones with separate IP addresses for the two slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we&apos;ve put our green environment live and we&apos;re happy with its stability, we then use the blue environment as
our &lt;strong&gt;staging environment&lt;/strong&gt; for the final testing step for our next deployment. When we are ready for our next
release, we switch from green to blue in the same way that we did from blue to green earlier. That way both green and
blue environments are regularly cycling between live, previous version (for rollback) and staging the next version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advantage of this approach is that it&apos;s the same basic mechanism as we need to get a hot-standby working. Hence
this allows us to test our disaster-recovery procedure on every release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental idea is to have two easily switchable environments to switch between, there are plenty of ways to vary
the details. One project did the switch by bouncing the web server rather than working on the router. Another
variation would be to use the same database, making the blue-green switches for web and domain layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases can often be a challenge with this technique, particularly when we need to change the schema to support a
new version of the software. The trick is to &lt;strong&gt;separate the deployment of schema changes from application upgrades&lt;/strong&gt;.
So first apply a database refactoring to change the schema to support both the new and old version of the application,
deploy that, check everything is working fine so we have a rollback point, then deploy the new version of the
application. (And when the upgrade has bedded down remove the database support for the old version.)
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster time to market&lt;/strong&gt;. It&apos;s common for the integration and test/fix phase of the traditional phased software
delivery lifecycle to consume weeks to even months. When teams work together to automate the build and deployment,
environment provisioning, and regression testing process, developers can incorporate integration and regression
testing into their daily work and completely remove these phases. We also avoid the large amount of re-work that
plague the phased approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher quality and Better products&lt;/strong&gt;. When developers have automated tools that discover regressions within minutes,
teams are freed to &lt;strong&gt;focus their effort on user research and higher level testing activities&lt;/strong&gt; such as exploratory
testing, usability testing, and performance and security testing. By building a deployment pipeline, these activities
can be performed continuously throughout the delivery process, ensuring quality is built into products and services
from the beginning. Continuous delivery makes it economic to work in small batches. This means we can get feedback
from users throughout the delivery lifecycle based on working software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower costs&lt;/strong&gt;. Any successful software product or service will evolve significantly over the course of its lifetime.
By investing in build, test, deployment and environment automation, we substantially reduce the cost of making and
delivering incremental changes to software by &lt;strong&gt;eliminating many of the fixed costs&lt;/strong&gt; associated with the release
process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happier teams&lt;/strong&gt;. Continuous Delivery makes releases less painful and reduces team burnout. Furthermore, when we
release more frequently, software delivery teams can engage more actively with users, learn which ideas work and which
don&apos;t, and see first-hand then outcomes of the work they have done. By removing low-value painful activities
accociated with software delivery, we can fodus on what we care about most - continuous delighting our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous delivery is about continuous, daily improvement - the constant discipline of pursuing higher performance by
following the heuristic &quot;if it hurts, do it more often, and bring the pain forward.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five principles at the heart of continuous delivery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build quality in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in small batches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is responsible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s easy to get bogged down in the details of implementing continuous delivery - tools, architecture, practices,
politics - if you find yourself lost, try revisiting these principles and you may find it helps you refocus on what&apos;s
important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build Quality In&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W. Edwards Deming, a key figure in the history of the Lean movement, offered
&lt;a href=&quot;https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points&quot;&gt;14 key principles&lt;/a&gt; for management. Principle three states, &quot;Cease
dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Eliminate the need for inspection on a mass basis by building quality into
the product in the first place&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s much cheaper to fix problems and defects if we find them immediately - ideally before they are ever checked into
version control, by running automated tests locally. Finding defects downstream through inspection (such as manual
testing) is time-consuming, requiring significant triage. Then we must fix the defect, trying to recall what we were
thinking when we introduced the problem days or perhaps even weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating and evolving feedback loops to detect problems as early as possible is essential and never-ending work in
continuous delivery. If we find a problem in our exploratory testing, we must not only fix it, but then ask: How could
we have caught the problem with an automated acceptance test? When an acceptance test fails, we should ask: Could we
have written a unit test to catch this problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Work in Small Batches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional phased approaches to software development, handoffs from dev to test or test to IT operations consist of
whole releases: months worth of work by teams consisting of tens or hundreds of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In continuous delivery, we take the opposite approach, and try and get every change in version control as far towards
release as we can, getting comprehensive feedback as rapidly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in small batches has many benefits. It reduces the time it takes to get feedback on our work, makes it easier to
triage and remediate problems, increases efficiency and motivation, and prevents us from succumbing to the sunk cost
fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we work in large batches is because of the large fixed cost of handing off changes. &lt;strong&gt;A key goal of
continuous delivery is to change the economics of the software delivery process to make it economically viable to work
in small batches so we can obtain the many benefits of this approach&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relentlessly Pursue Continuous Improvement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous improvement, or &lt;em&gt;kaizen&lt;/em&gt; in Japanese, is another key idea from the Lean movement.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071808019?tag=contindelive-20&quot;&gt;Taiichi Ohno&lt;/a&gt;, a key figure in the history of the Toyota
company, once said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kaizen opportunitites are infinite. Don&apos;t think you have made things better than before and be at ease… This would be
like the student who becomes proud because they bested their master two times out of three in fencing. Once you pick
up the sprouts of kaizen ideas, it is important to have the attitude in our daily work that just underneath one kaizen
idea is yet another one&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t treat transformation as a project to be embarked on and then completed so we can return to business as usual. The
best organizations are those where everybody treats improvement work as an essential part of their daily work, and where
nobody is satisfied with the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Everyone is Responsible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high performing organizations, nothing is &quot;somebody else&apos;s problem.&quot; Developers are responsible for the quality and
stability of the software they build. Operations teams are responsible for helping developers build quality in. Everyone
works together to achieve the organizational level goals, rather than optimizing for what’s best for their team or
department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people make local optimizations that reduce the overall performance of the organization, it&apos;s often due to systemic
problems such as poor management systems such as annual budgeting cycles, or incentives that reward the wrong behaviors.
A classic example is rewarding developers for increasing their velocity or writing more code, and rewarding testers
based on the number of bugs they find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people want to do the right thing, but they will adapt their behaviour based on how they are rewarded. Therefore,
it is very important to create fast feedback loops from the things that really matter: how customers react to what we
build for them, and the impact on our organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foundations - Prerequisites for Continuous Delivery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configuration Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation plays a vital role in ensuring we can release software repeatably and reliably. One key goal is to take
repetitive manual processes like build, deployment, regression testing and infrastructure provisioning, and automate
them. In order to achieve this, we need to version control everything required to perform these processes, including
source code, test and deployment scripts, infrastructure and application configuration information, and the many
libraries and packages we depend upon. We also want to make it straightforward to query the current -and historical -
state of our environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two overriding goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproducibility&lt;/strong&gt;: We should be able to provision any environment in a fully automated fashion, and know that any
new environment reproduced from the same configuration is identical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traceability&lt;/strong&gt;: We should be able to pick any environment and be able to determine quickly and precisely the
versions of every dependency used to create that environment. We also want to be able to compare previous versions of
an environment and see what has changed between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These capabilities give us several very important benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaster recovery&lt;/strong&gt;: When something goes wrong with one of our environments, for example a hardware failure or a
security breach, we need to be able to reproduce that environment in a deterministic amount of time in order to be
able to restore service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auditability&lt;/strong&gt;: In order to demonstrate the integrity of the delivery process, we need to be able to show the path
backwards from every deployment to the elements it came from, including their version. Comprehensive configuration
management, combined with deployment pipelines, enable this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher quality&lt;/strong&gt;: The software delivery process is often subject to long delays waiting for development, testing
and production environments to be prepared. When this can be done automatically from version control, we can get
feedback on the impact of our changes much more rapidly, enabling us to build quality in to our software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity management&lt;/strong&gt;: When we want to add more capacity to our environments, the ability to create new
reproductions of existing servers is essential. This capability, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstack.org/&quot;&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; for
example, enables the horizontal scaling of modern cloud-based distributed systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response to defects&lt;/strong&gt;: When we discover a critical defect, or a vulnerability in some component of our system, we
want to get a new version of our software released as quickly as possible. Many organizations have an emergency
process for this type of change which goes faster by bypassing some of the testing and auditing. This presents an
especially serious dilemma in safety-critical systems. Our goal should be to be able to use our normal release
process for emergency fixes - which is precisely what continuous delivery enables, on the basis of comprehensive
configuration management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As environments become more complex and heterogeneous, it becomes progressively harder to achieve these goals. Achieving
perfect reproducibility and traceability to the last byte for a complex enterprise system is impossible (apart from
anything else, every real system has state). Thus a key part of configuration management is working to &lt;strong&gt;simplify our
architecture, environments and processes&lt;/strong&gt; to reduce the investment required to achieve the desired benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Configuration Management Learning Resources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/infrastructure-as-code/9781491924334/&quot;&gt;Infrastructure as Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/scaling-operations-facebook&quot;&gt;Pedro Canahuati on scaling operations at Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the work of multiple developers is hard. Software systems are complex, and an apparently simple,
self-contained change to a single file can easily have unintended consequences which compromise the correctness of the
system. As a result, some teams have developers work isolated from each other on their own branches, both to keep
trunk/master stable, and to prevent them treading on each other’s toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, over time these branches diverge from each other. While merging a single one of these branches into mainline is
not usually troublesome, the work required to integrate multiple long-lived branches into mainline is usually painful,
requiring significant amounts of re-work as conflicting assumptions of developers are revealed and must be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams using long-lived branches often require code freezes, or even integration and stabilization phases, as they work
to integrate these branches prior to a release. Despite modern tooling, this process is still expensive and
unpredictable. On teams larger than a few developers, the integration of multiple branches requires multiple rounds of
regression testing and bug fixing to validate that the system will work as expected following these merges. This problem
becomes exponentially more severe as team sizes grow, and as branches become more long-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of continuous integration was invented to address these problems. CI (continuous integration) follows the
XP (extreme programming) principle that if something is painful, we should do it more often, and bring the pain forward.
Thus in CI developers integrate all their work into trunk (also known as mainline or master) on a regular basis (at
least daily). A set of automated tests is run both &lt;strong&gt;before and after&lt;/strong&gt; the merge to validate that no regressions are
introduced. If these automated tests fail, the team stops what they are doing and someone fixes the problem immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we ensure that the software is always in a working state, and that developer branches do not diverge significantly
from trunk. The benefits of continuous integration are very significant - higher levels of throughput, more stable
systems, and higher quality software. However the practice is still controversial, for two main reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it requires developers to break up large features and other changes into smaller, more incremental steps that can
be integrated into trunk/master. This is a paradigm shift for developers who are not used to working in this way. It also
takes longer to get large features completed. However in general we don&apos;t want to optimize for the speed at which
developers can declare their work &quot;dev complete&quot; on a branch. Rather, we want to be able to get changes reviewed,
integrated, tested and deployed as fast as possible - and this process is an order of magnitude faster and cheaper when
the changes are small and self-contained, and the branches they live on are short-lived. Working in small batches also
ensures developers get regular feedback on the impact of their work on the system as a whole - from other developers,
testers, customers, and automated performance and security tests—which in turn makes any problems easier to detect,
triage, and fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, continuous integration requires a fast-running set of comprehensive automated unit tests. These tests should be
comprehensive enough to give a good level of confidence that the software will work as expected, while also running in a
few minutes or less. If the automated unit tests take longer to run, developers will not want to run them frequently,
and they will become harder to maintain. Creating maintainable suites of automated unit tests is complex and is best done
through test-driven development (TDD), in which developers write failing automated tests before they implement the code
that makes the tests pass. TDD has several benefits, the most important of which is that it ensures developers write code
that is modular and easy to test, reducing the maintenance cost of the resulting automated test suites. But TDD is still
not sufficiently widely practiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these barriers, &lt;strong&gt;helping software development teams implement continuous integration should be the number one
priority for any organization&lt;/strong&gt; wanting to start the journey to continuous delivery. By creating rapid feedback loops
and ensuring developers work in small batches, CI enables teams to build quality into their software, thus reducing the
cost of ongoing software development, and increasing both the productivity of teams and the quality of the work they
produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Continuous Integration Learning Resources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321336380?tag=contindelive-20&quot;&gt;Paul Duvall&apos;s book on Continuous Integration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continuous Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to building quality into our software is making sure we can get fast feedback on the impact of changes.
Traditionally, extensive use was made of manual inspection of code changes and manual testing (testers following
documentation describing the steps required to test the various functions of the system) in order to demonstrate the
correctness of the system. This type of testing was normally done in a phase following “dev complete”. However this
strategy have several drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manual regression testing takes a long time and is relatively expensive to perform, creating a bottleneck that
prevents us releasing software more frequently, and getting feedback to developers weeks (and sometimes months) after
they wrote the code being tested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manual tests and inspections are not very reliable, since people are notoriously poor at performing repetitive tasks
such as regression testing manually, and it is extremely hard to predict the impact of a set of changes on a complex
software system through inspection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When systems are evolving over time, as is the case in modern software products and services, we have to spend
considerable effort updating test documentation to keep it up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to build quality in to software, we need to adopt a
&lt;a href=&quot;#different-types-of-software-testing&quot;&gt;different approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more features and improvements go into our code, the more we&apos;ll need to test to make sure that all our system works
properly. And then for each bug we fix, it would be wise to check that they don&apos;t get back in newer releases.
Automation is key to make this possible and writing tests sooner rather than later will become part of our development
workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have continuous integration and test automation in place, we create a
&lt;a href=&quot;#the-deployment-pipeline&quot;&gt;deployment pipeline&lt;/a&gt;. In the deployment pipeline pattern, every change runs a build that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creates packages that can be deployed to any environment and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runs unit tests (and possibly other tasks such as static analysis), giving feedback to developers in the space of a
few minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packages that pass this set of tests have more comprehensive automated acceptance tests run against them. Once we have
packages that pass all the automated tests, they are available for deplyment to other environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the deployment pipeline, every change is effectively a release candidate. The job of the deployment pipeline is to
catch known issues. If we can&apos;t detect any known problems, we should feel totally comfortable releasing any packages
that have gone through it. If we aren&apos;t, or if we discover defects later, it means we need to improve our pipeline,
perhaps adding or updating some tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal should be to find problems as soon as possible, and make the lead time from check-in to release as short as
possible. Thus we want to parallelize the activities in the deployment pipeline, not have many stages executing in
series. If we discover a defect in the acceptance tests, we should be looking to improve our unit tests (most of our
defects should be discovered through unit testing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Different Types of Software Testing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Unit Tests&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit tests are very low level and close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and
functions of the classes, components, or modules used by our software. Unit tests are generally quite cheap to automate
and can run very quickly by a continuous integration server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Integration Tests&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by our application work well together. For example, it
can be testing the interaction with the database or making sure that microservices work together as expected. These
types of tests are more expensive to run as they require multiple parts of the application to be up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Functional Tests&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional tests focus on the business requirements of an application. They only verify the output of an action and do
not check the intermediate states of the system when performing that action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is sometimes a confusion between integration tests and functional tests as they both require multiple components
to interact with each other. The difference is that an integration test may simply verify that we can query the
database while a functional test would expect to get a specific value from the database as defined by the product
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;End-to-End Tests&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-to-end testing replicates a user behavior with the software in a complete application environment. It verifies that
various user flows work as expected and can be as simple as loading a web page or logging in or much more complex
scenarios verifying email notifications, online payments, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-to-end tests are very useful, but they&apos;re expensive to perform and can be hard to maintain when they&apos;re automated.
It is recommended to have a few key end-to-end tests and rely more on lower level types of testing (unit and
integration tests) to be able to quickly identify breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Acceptance Tests&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire
application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. But they can also go further and
measure the performance of the system and reject changes if certain goals are not met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Performance Tests&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance tests evaluate how a system performs under a particular workload. These tests help to measure the
reliability, speed, scalability, and responsiveness of an application. For instance, a performance test can observe
response times when executing a high number of requests, or determine how a system behaves with a significant amount of
data. It can determine if an application meets performance requirements, locate bottlenecks, measure stability during
peak traffic, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Smoke Tests&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke tests are basic tests that check the basic functionality of an application. They are meant to be quick to
execute, and their goal is to give us the assurance that the major features of our system are working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke tests can be useful right after a new build is made to decide whether or not we can run more expensive tests, or
right after a deployment to make sure that they application is running properly in the newly deployed environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementing Continuous Delivery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations attempting to deploy continuous delivery tend to make two common mistakes. The first is to treat
continuous delivery as an end-state, a goal in itself. The second is to spend a lot of time and energy worrying about
what products to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Evolutionary Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of enterprise architecture there are typically multiple attributes we are concerned about, for example
availability, security, performance, usability and so forth. In continuous delivery, we introduce two new architectural
attributes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;testability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;deployability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;testable&lt;/em&gt; architecture, we design our software such that most defects can (in principle, at least) be discovered
by developers by running automated tests on their workstations. We shouldn’t need to depend on complex, integrated
environments in order to do the majority of our acceptance and regression testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;deployable&lt;/em&gt; architecture, deployments of a particular product or service can be performed independently and in a
fully automated fashion, without the need for significant levels of orchestration. Deployable systems can typically be
upgraded or reconfigured with zero or minimal downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where testability and deployability are not prioritized, we find that much testing requires the use of complex,
integrated environments, and deployments are &quot;big bang&quot; events that require that many services are released at the same
time due to complex interdependencies. These &quot;big bang&quot; deployments require many teams to work together in a carefully
orchestrated fashion with many hand-offs, and dependencies between hundreds or thousands of tasks. Such deployments
typically take many hours or even days, and require scheduling significant downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing for testability and deployability starts with ensuring our products and services are composed of
loosely-coupled, well-encapsulated components or modules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can define a well-designed modular architecture as one in which it is possible to test or deploy a single component
or service on its own, with any dependencies replaced by a suitable test double, which could be in the form of a virtual
machine, a stub, or a mock. Each component or service should be deployable in a fully automated fashion on developer
workstations, test environments, or in production. In a well-designed architecture, it is possible to get a high level of
confidence the component is operating properly when deployed in this fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note Test Double&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test Double is a generic term for any case where you replace a production object for testing purposes. There are various
kinds of double:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dummy&lt;/strong&gt; objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fake&lt;/strong&gt; objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable
for production (an InMemoryTestDatabase is a good example).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stubs&lt;/strong&gt; provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside
what&apos;s programmed in for the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spies&lt;/strong&gt; are stubs that also record some information based on how they were called. One form of this might be an email
service that records how many messages it was sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mocks&lt;/strong&gt; are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.
They can throw an exception if they receive a call they don&apos;t expect and are checked during verification to ensure
they got all the calls they were expecting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any true service-oriented architecture should have these properties—but unfortunately many do not. However, the
microservices movement has explicitly prioritized these architectural properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, many organizations are living in a world where services are distinctly hard to test and deploy. Rather than
re-architecting everything, we recommend an iterative approach to improving the design of enterprise system, sometimes
known as evolutionary architecture. In the evolutionary architecture paradigm, we accept that successful products and
services will require re-architecting during their lifecycle due to the changing requirements placed on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pattern that is particularly valuable in this context is the strangler application. In this pattern, we iteratively
replace a monolithic architecture with a more componentized one by ensuring that new work is done following the
principles of a service-oriented architecture, while accepting that the new architecture may well delegate to the system
it is replacing. Over time, more and more functionality will be performed in the new architecture, and the old system
being replaced is &quot;strangled&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/strangler.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Deployment Pipeline&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key pattern introduced in continuous delivery is the &lt;strong&gt;deployment pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;. Our goal was to make deployment to any
environment a fully automated, scripted process that could be performed on demand in minutes. We wanted to be able to
configure testing and production environments purely from configuration files stored in version control. The apparatus
we used to perform these tasks became known as &lt;em&gt;deployment pipelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the deployment pipeline pattern, every change in version control triggers a process (usually in a CI server) which
creates deployable packages and runs automated unit tests and other validations such as static code analysis. This first
step is optimized so that it takes only a few minutes to run. If this initial commit stage fails, the problem must be
fixed immediately; nobody should check in more work on a broken commit stage. Every passing commit stage triggers the
next step in the pipeline, which might consist of a more comprehensive set of automated tests. Versions of the software
that pass all the automated tests can then be deployed to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment pipelines tie together &lt;a href=&quot;#configuration-management&quot;&gt;configuration management&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;#continuous-integration&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#continuous-testing&quot;&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; and deployment automation in a
holistic, powerful way that works to improve software quality, increase stability, and reduce the time and cost required
to make incremental changes to software, whatever domain we&apos;re operating in. When building a deployment pipeline, the
following practices become valuable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only build packages once&lt;/strong&gt;. We want to be sure the thing we&apos;re deploying is the same thing we&apos;ve tested throughout
the deployment pipeline, so if a deployment fails we can eliminate the packages as the source of the failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy the same way to every environment, including development&lt;/strong&gt;. This way, we test the deployment process many,
many times before it gets to production, and again, we can eliminate it as the source of any problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoke test your deployments&lt;/strong&gt;. Have a script that validates all your application&apos;s dependencies are available, at
the location you have configured your application. Make sure your application is running and available as part of the
deployment process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your environments similar&lt;/strong&gt;. Although they may differ in hardware configuration, they should have the same
version of the operating system and middleware packages, and they should be configured in the same way. This has
become much easier to achieve with modern virtualization and container technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of infrastructure as code, it has became possible to use deployment pipelines to create a fully
automated process for taking all kinds of changes—including database and infrastructure changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patterns for Low-Risk Releases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of web-based systems there are a number of patterns that can be applied to further reduce the risk of
deployments. Michael Nygard also describes a number of important software design patterns which are instrumental in
creating resilient large-scale systems in his book
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0978739213?tag=contindelive-20&quot;&gt;Release It!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3 key principles that enable low-risk releases are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimize for Resilience&lt;/strong&gt;. Once we accept that failures are inevitable, we should start to move away from the idea
of investing all our effort in preventing problems, and think instead about how to restore service as rapidly as
possible when something goes wrong. Furthermore, when an accident occurs, we should treat it as a learning
opportunity. Resilience isn&apos;t just a feature of our systems, it&apos;s a characteristic of a team&apos;s culture. High
performance organizations are constantly working to improve the resilience of their systems by trying to break them
and implementing the lessons learned in the course of doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-risk Releases are Incremental&lt;/strong&gt;. Our goal is to architect our systems such that we can release individual
changes (including database changes) independently, rather than having to orchestrate big-bang releases due to tight
coupling between multiple different systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Reducing Batch Size&lt;/strong&gt;. Counterintuitively, deploying to production more frequently actually reduces the
risk of release when done properly, simply because the amount of change in each deployment is smaller. When each
deployment consists of tens of lines of code or a few configuration settings, it becomes much easier to perform root
cause analysis and restore service in the case of an incident. Furthermore, because we practice the deployment
process so frequently, we’re forced to simplify and automate it which further reduces risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deploying v.s. Releasing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Software Release&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A release is &lt;strong&gt;a collection of one or more new or changed services or service components deployed into the live
environment as a result of one or more changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, a release makes services and features available to users. More often than not,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmc.com/blogs/devops-release-management/&quot;&gt;release management&lt;/a&gt; is more of a business responsibility than a
technical responsibility. This is because the decisions on scheduling releases can be tied to business strategy from a
revenue or portfolio management perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment involves moving software from one controlled environment to another. &lt;strong&gt;An environment is a subset of IT
infrastructure used for a particular purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. The most common environments are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development&lt;/strong&gt;. Commonly referred to as &lt;em&gt;dev&lt;/em&gt;, this is where developers build the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, the new code is combined and validated that it works with existing code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where both functional and non-functional tests are conducted on the merged code to confirm it meets
organization and customer requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staging&lt;/strong&gt;. This environment is used to test the software using real data to validate it is ready for use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production&lt;/strong&gt;. Commonly referred to as prod, this is where the software is made available to users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Trunk-Based Development&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trunk-based development is a version control management practice where developers merge small, frequent updates to a
core &quot;trunk&quot; or main branch. Since it streamlines merging and integration phases, it helps achieve CI/CD and increases
software delivery and organizational performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of software development, programmers didn&apos;t have the luxury of modern version control systems. Rather,
they developed two versions of their software concurrently as a means of tracking changes and reversing them if
necessary. Over time, this process proved to be labor-intensive, costly, and inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As version control systems matured, various development styles emerged, enabling programmers to find bugs more easily,
code in parallel with their colleagues, and accelerate release cadence. Today, most programmers leverage one of two
development models to deliver quality software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gitflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trunk-based development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gitflow, which was popularized first, is a stricter development model where only certain individuals can approve changes
to the main code. This maintains code quality and minimizes the number of bugs. Trunk-based development is a more open
model since all developers have access to the main code. This enables teams to iterate quickly and implement
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery&quot;&gt;CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What is Trunk-Based Development&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trunk-based development is a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control&quot;&gt;version control management&lt;/a&gt; practice where developers
merge small, frequent updates to a  core &quot;trunk&quot; or main branch. It&apos;s a common practice among
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops&quot;&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt; teams and part of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops/devops-best-practices&quot;&gt;DevOps lifecycle&lt;/a&gt; since it streamlines merging
and integration phases. In fact, trunk-based development is a required practice of CI/CD. Developers can create
short-lived branches with a few small commits compared to other long-lived feature branching strategies. As codebase
complexity and team size grow, trunk-based development helps keep production releases flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Gitflow vs. Trunk-Based Development&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow&quot;&gt;Gitflow&lt;/a&gt; is an alternative Git branching
model that uses long-lived feature branches and multiple primary branches. Gitflow has more, longer-lived branches and
larger commits than trunk-based development. Under this model, developers create a feature branch and delay merging it
to the main trunk branch until the feature is complete. These long-lived feature branches require more collaboration to
merge as they have a higher risk of deviating from the trunk branch and introducing conflicting updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gitflow also has separate primary branch lines for development, hotfixes, features, and releases. There are different
strategies for merging commits between these branches. Since there are more branches to juggle and manage, there is
often more complexity that requires additional planning sessions and review from the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trunk-based development is far more simplified since it focuses on the main branch as the source of fixes and releases.
In trunk-based development the main branch is assumed to always be stable, without issues, and ready to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Benefits of Trunk-Based Development&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trunk-based development is a required practice for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;. If build and test
processes are automated but developers work on isolated, lengthy feature branches that are infrequently integrated into
a shared branch, continuous integration is not living up to its potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trunk-based development eases the friction of code integration. When developers finish new work, they must merge the new
code into the main branch. Yet they should not merge changes to the truck until they have verified that they can build
successfully. During this phase, conflicts may arise if modifications have been made since the new work began. In
particular, these conflicts are increasingly complex as development teams grow and the code base scales. This happens
when developers create separate branches that deviate from the source branch and other developers are simultaneously
merging overlapping code. Luckily, the trunk-based development model reduces these conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Allows Continuous Code Integration&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the trunk-based development model, there is a repository with a steady stream of commits flowing into the main
branch. Adding an automated test suite and code coverage monitoring for this stream of commits enables continuous
integration. When new code is merged into the trunk, automated integration and code coverage tests run to validate the
code quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Ensures Continuous Code Review&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid, small commits of trunk-based development make code review a more efficient process. With small branches,
developers can quickly see and review small changes. This is far easier compared to a long-lived feature branch where a
reviewer reads pages of code or manually inspects a large surface area of code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Enables Consecutive Production Code Releases&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams should make frequent, daily merges to the main branch. Trunk-based development strives to keep the trunk branch
&quot;green&quot;, meaning it&apos;s ready to deploy at any commit. Automated tests, code converge, and code reviews provides a
trunk-based development project with the assurances it&apos;s ready to deploy to production at any time. This gives team
agility to frequently deploy to production and set further goals of daily production releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As CI/CD grew in popularity, branching models were refined and optimized, leading to the rise of trunk-based
development. Now, trunk-based development is a requirement of continuous integration. With continuous integration,
developers perform trunk-based development in conjunction with automated tests that run after each committee to a
trunk. This ensures the project works at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Trunk-Based Development Best Practices&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trunk-based development ensures teams release code quickly and consistently. The following is a list of exercises and
practices that will help refine your team&apos;s cadence and develop an optimized release schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Develop in Small Batches&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trunk-based development follows a quick rhythm to deliver code to production. If trunk-based development was like music
it would be a rapid staccato -- short, succinct notes in rapid succession, with the repository commits being the notes.
&lt;strong&gt;Keeping commits and branches small&lt;/strong&gt; allows for a more rapid tempo of merges and deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small changes of a couple of commits or modification of a few lines of code minimize cognitive overhead. It&apos;s much
easier for teams to have meaningful conversations and make quick decisions when reviewing a limited area of code versus
a sprawling set of changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Feature Flags&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature flags nicely compliment trunk-based development by enabling developers to wrap new changes in an inactive code
path and activate it at a later time. This allows developers to forgo creating a separate repository feature branch and
instead commit new feature code directly to the main branch within a feature flag path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Implement Comprehensive Automated Testing&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated testing is necessary for any modern software project intending to achieve CI/CD&lt;/strong&gt;. There are multiple types
of automated tests that run at different stages of the release pipeline. Short running unit and integration tests are
executed during development and upon code merge. Longer running, full stack, end-to-end tests are run in later pipeline
phases against a full staging or production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated tests help trunk-based development by maintaining a small batch rhythm as developers merge new commits. The
automated test suite reviews the code for any issues and automatically approves or denies it. This helps developers
rapidly create commits and run them through automated tests to see if they introduce any new issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Perform Asynchronous Code Reviews&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trunk-based development, code review should be performed immediately and not put into an asynchronous system for
later review. Automated tests provide a layer of preemptive code review. When developers are ready to review a team
member&apos;s pull request, they can first check that the automated tests passed and the code coverage has increased. This
gives the reviewer immediate reassurance that the new code meets certain specifications. The reviewer can then focus on
optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Have Three or Fewer Active Branches in the Application&apos;s Code Repository&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a branch merges, it is best practice to delete it. &lt;strong&gt;A repository with a large amount of active branches has some
unfortunate side effects&lt;/strong&gt;. While it can be beneficial for teams to see what work is in progress by examining active
branches, this benefit is lost if there are stale and inactive branches still around. Some developers use Git user
interfaces that may become unwieldy to work with when loading a large number of remote branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Merge Branches to the Trunk at Least Once a Day&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performing, trunk-based development teams should close out and merge any open and merge-ready branches at least on
a daily basis. This exercise helps keep rhythm and sets a cadence for release tracking. The team can then tag the main
trunk at the end of day as a release commit, which has the helpful side effect of generating a daily agile release
increment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Reduced Number of Code Freezes and Integration Phases&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agile CI/CD teams shouldn&apos;t need planned code freezes or pauses for integration phases&lt;/strong&gt; -- although an organization
may need them for other reasons. The &quot;continuous&quot; in CI/CD implies that updates are constantly flowing. Trunk-based
development teams should try to avoid blocking code freezes and plan accordingly to ensure the release pipeline is not
stalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Build Fast and Execute Immediately&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain a quick release cadence, build and test execution times should be optimized. CI/CD build tools
should use caching layers where appropriate to avoid expensive computations for static. &lt;strong&gt;Tests should be optimized to
use appropriate stubs for third-party services&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Should We Pin Our GitHub Actions by commit-hash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply chain attacks are not something new; we have heard about them extensively, and the maximum we can do is mitigate
them as best as we can. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that these types of attacks will always exist. With that
in mind, it is important to understand all the attack vectors and take the necessary steps to secure our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the initiatives planned by the Node.js Security WG (Working Group) for 2023 is to enhance the OSSF Scorecard.
This task requires changing all Node.js actions to be pinned by commit-hash. The reason for this approach is quite
simple: commit-hash provides immutability, unlike tags which do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, it is quite common to include the following action as part of our application&apos;s CI pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs:
  build:
    name: Build, push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout master
      uses: actions/checkout@v3.5.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many developers rely on tools like Dependabot or Renovatebot to ensure that these actions stay up-to-date. However,
using the release tag can pose a risk to our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Looking at a Scenario Where a Malicious Actor Gets Control&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s consider a scenario where a malicious actor gains control over the &lt;code&gt;actions/checkout&lt;/code&gt; package. This compromised
package can now potentially manipulate the entire CI process. It can access environment variables used by other jobs,
write to a shared directory that subsequent jobs process, make remote calls, inject malicious code into the production
binary, and perform other malicious activities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What many developers assume is that once they pin an action using a release tag, such as v3.5.2, they are safe because
any new changes would require a new release. However, this assumption is fundamentally incorrect. Release tags are
&lt;strong&gt;mutable&lt;/strong&gt;, and a malicious actor can override them. To illustrate this point, I have created two repositories for
educational purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RafaelGSS/bad-action&quot;&gt;bad-action&lt;/a&gt; - This repository contains a GitHub action that simulates
someone taking over the package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RafaelGSS/using-bad-action&quot;&gt;using-bad-action&lt;/a&gt; - This repository demonstrates a project that
utilizes the aforementioned action, as the name suggests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;.github/workflows/main.yml&lt;/code&gt; file of the latter repository, the &lt;code&gt;bad-action&lt;/code&gt; is being used in version v1.0.1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  example_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: RafaelGSS/bad-action@v1.0.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this practical example, &lt;code&gt;workflow_dispatch&lt;/code&gt; will be used, but the same applies to &lt;code&gt;on: [push, pull_request]&lt;/code&gt;
processes and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, when the action is executed, it prints “Hello world” in the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&apos;s consider the scenario where a bad actor takes over the repository and modifies the &quot;Hello world&quot; message to
&quot;Hello darkness my old friend&quot; without creating a new release. Instead, the actor overrides the existing v1.0.1 release
using the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &quot;echo \&quot;Hello darkness my old friend\&quot;&quot; &amp;gt; run.sh
git add run.sh
git commit -m &quot;dangerous commit&quot;
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.1
git tag -fa v1.0.1
git push origin main --tags
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, if the action is executed again without any changes made to the source code, it will print &quot;Hello darkness
my old friend&quot;. This demonstrates how our environment can be exploited by manipulating release tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinning an action to a full-length commit SHA is currently the only method to ensure the use of an action as an
immutable release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note[Quoting the OSSF Scorecard]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinned dependencies help reduce various security risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They guarantee that checking and deployment are performed with the same software, minimizing deployment risks,
simplifying debugging, and enabling reproducibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can help mitigate compromised dependencies from compromising the project&apos;s security. By evaluating the pinned
dependency and being confident that it is not compromised, we can prevent the use of a later version that may be
compromised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinned dependencies are a way to counter dependency confusion (or substitution) attacks. In these attacks, an
application uses multiple feeds to acquire software packages (a “hybrid configuration”), and attackers trick the user
into using a malicious package from an unexpected feed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, fixing or securing the action is a straightforward process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  example_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: RafaelGSS/bad-action@e20fd1d81b3f403df56f5f06e2aa9653a6a60763  # v1.0.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a comment referring to the tag enables automated dependency updates, such as Dependabot or Renovatebot, to update it whenever a new release is detected. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/1009&quot;&gt;We can see an example of this in action in the Node.js Security WG repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are open-source tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stepsecurity.io/&quot;&gt;StepSecurity&lt;/a&gt; that can assist us in addressing these
concerns. It generates automated pull requests for our codebase based on the configuration specified on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using a GitHub Action Matrix to Define Variations for Each Job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A matrix strategy lets you use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs that are
based on the combinations of the variables. For example, you can use a matrix strategy to test your code in multiple
versions of a language or on multiple operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Using a Matrix Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.strategy.matrix&lt;/code&gt; to define a matrix of different job configurations. Within your matrix, define one
or more variables followed by an array of values. For example, the following matrix has a variable called &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; with
the value &lt;code&gt;[10, 12, 14]&lt;/code&gt; and a variable called os with the value &lt;code&gt;[ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: [10, 12, 14]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A job will run for each possible combination of the variables. In this example, the workflow will run six jobs, one for
each combination of the &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, GitHub will maximize the number of jobs run in parallel depending on runner availability. The &lt;strong&gt;order of the
variables in the matrix determines the order in which the jobs are created&lt;/strong&gt;. The first variable you define will be the
first job that is created in your workflow run. For example, the above matrix will create the jobs in the following
order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{version: 10, os: ubuntu-latest}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{version: 10, os: windows-latest}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{version: 12, os: ubuntu-latest}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{version: 12, os: windows-latest}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{version: 14, os: ubuntu-latest}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{version: 14, os: windows-latest}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A matrix will generate a maximum of &lt;strong&gt;256&lt;/strong&gt; jobs per workflow run. This limit applies to both GitHub-hosted and
self-hosted runners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variables that you define become properties in the matrix context, and you can reference the property in other areas
of your workflow file. In this example, you can use &lt;code&gt;matrix.version&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;matrix.os&lt;/code&gt; to access the current value of
version and os that the job is using. For more information, see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts&quot;&gt;Contexts&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example: Using a Single-Dimension Matrix&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can specify a single variable to create a single-dimension matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the following workflow defines the variable version with the values &lt;code&gt;[10, 12, 14]&lt;/code&gt;. The workflow will run
three jobs, one for each value in the variable. Each job will access the version value through the &lt;code&gt;matrix.version&lt;/code&gt;
context and pass the value as &lt;code&gt;node-version&lt;/code&gt; to the actions/setup-node action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example: Using a Multi-dimension Matrix&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can specify multiple variables to create a multi-dimensional matrix. A job will run for each possible combination of
the variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the following workflow specifies two variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two operating systems specified in the &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three Node.js versions specified in the &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workflow will run six jobs, one for each combination of the &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; variables. Each job will set the
&lt;code&gt;runs-on&lt;/code&gt; value to the current &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; value and will pass the current version value to the &lt;code&gt;actions/setup-node&lt;/code&gt; action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-22.04, ubuntu-20.04]
        version: [10, 12, 14]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@49933ea5288caeca8642d1e84afbd3f7d6820020  # v4.4.0
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.version }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example: Using Contexts to Create Matrices&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use contexts to create matrices. For more information about contexts, see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts&quot;&gt;Contexts&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the following workflow triggers on the &lt;code&gt;repository_dispatch&lt;/code&gt; event and uses information from the event
payload to build the matrix. When a repository dispatch event is created with a payload like the one below, the matrix
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; variable will have a value of &lt;code&gt;[12, 14, 16]&lt;/code&gt;. For more information about the &lt;code&gt;repository_dispatch&lt;/code&gt; trigger,
see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch&quot;&gt;Events that trigger workflows&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    &quot;event_type&quot;: &quot;test&quot;,
    &quot;client_payload&quot;: {
        &quot;versions&quot;: [12, 14, 16]
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types:
      - test

jobs:
  example_matrix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: ${{ github.event.client_payload.versions }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@49933ea5288caeca8642d1e84afbd3f7d6820020  # v4.4.0
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.version }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Expanding or adding matrix configurations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.strategy.matrix.include&lt;/code&gt; to expand existing matrix configurations or to add new configurations. The
value of include is a list of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each object in the &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; list, the key:value pairs in the object will be added to each of the matrix
combinations if none of the key:value pairs overwrite any of the original matrix values. If the object cannot be added
to any of the matrix combinations, a new matrix combination will be created instead. Note that the original matrix
values will not be overwritten, but added matrix values can be overwritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;strategy:
  matrix:
    fruit: [apple, pear]
    animal: [cat, dog]
    include:
      - color: green
      - color: pink
        animal: cat
      - fruit: apple
        shape: circle
      - fruit: banana
      - fruit: banana
        animal: cat
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will result in six jobs with the following matrix combinations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{fruit: apple, animal: cat, color: pink, shape: circle}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{fruit: apple, animal: dog, color: green, shape: circle}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{fruit: pear, animal: cat, color: pink}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{fruit: pear, animal: dog, color: green}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{fruit: banana}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{fruit: banana, animal: cat}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;following this logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{color: green}&lt;/code&gt; is added to all of the original matrix combinations because it can be added without overwriting any
part of the original combinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{color: pink, animal: cat}&lt;/code&gt; adds &lt;code&gt;color:pink&lt;/code&gt; only to the original matrix combinations that include &lt;code&gt;animal: cat&lt;/code&gt;.
This overwrites the color: green that was added by the previous include entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{fruit: apple, shape: circle}&lt;/code&gt; adds shape: circle only to the original matrix combinations that include
&lt;code&gt;fruit: apple&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{fruit: banana}&lt;/code&gt; cannot be added to any original matrix combination without overwriting a value, so it is added as an
additional matrix combination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{fruit: banana, animal: cat}&lt;/code&gt; cannot be added to any original matrix combination without overwriting a value, so it
is added as an additional matrix combination. It does not add to the &lt;code&gt;{fruit: banana}&lt;/code&gt; matrix combination because that
combination was not one of the original matrix combinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like kinda &quot;what&apos;re we doing here???&quot;. But let us just look at the following examples which make it more
clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following workflow will run six jobs, one for each combination of &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; and node. When the job for the os value of
&lt;code&gt;windows-latest&lt;/code&gt; and node value of &lt;code&gt;16&lt;/code&gt; runs, an additional variable called &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; with the value of &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; will be included
in the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [windows-latest, ubuntu-latest]
        node: [12, 14, 16]
        include:
          - os: windows-latest
            node: 16
            npm: 6
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@49933ea5288caeca8642d1e84afbd3f7d6820020  # v4.4.0
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - if: ${{ matrix.npm }}
        run: npm install -g npm@${{ matrix.npm }}
      - run: npm --version
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matrix will run 10 jobs, one for each combination of &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; in the matrix, plus a job for the &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt;
value of &lt;code&gt;windows-latest&lt;/code&gt; and version value of &lt;code&gt;17&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, windows-latest, ubuntu-latest]
        version: [12, 14, 16]
        include:
          - os: windows-latest
            version: 17
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t specify any matrix variables, all configurations under &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; will run. For example, the following
workflow would run two jobs, one for each &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; entry. This lets you take advantage of the matrix strategy without
having a fully populated matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs:
  includes_only:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - site: &quot;production&quot;
            datacenter: &quot;site-a&quot;
          - site: &quot;staging&quot;
            datacenter: &quot;site-b&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Excluding Matrix Configurations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove specific configurations defined in the matrix, use &lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.strategy.matrix.exclude&lt;/code&gt;. An excluded
configuration only has to be a partial match for it to be excluded. For example, the following workflow will run nine
jobs: one job for each of the 12 configurations, minus the one excluded job that matches
&lt;code&gt;{os: macos-latest, version: 12, environment: production}&lt;/code&gt;, and the two excluded jobs that match
&lt;code&gt;{os: windows-latest, version: 16}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [macos-latest, windows-latest]
    version: [12, 14, 16]
    environment: [staging, production]
    exclude:
      - os: macos-latest
        version: 12
        environment: production
      - os: windows-latest
        version: 16
runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: All &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; combinations are processed after &lt;code&gt;exclude&lt;/code&gt;. This allows you to use &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; to add back
combinations that were previously excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Handling Failures&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can control how job failures are handled with &lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.strategy.fail-fast&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.continue-on-error&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.strategy.fail-fast&lt;/code&gt; applies to the entire matrix. If &lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.strategy.fail-fast&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;,
GitHub will cancel all in-progress and queued jobs in the matrix if any job in the matrix fails. This property defaults
to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.continue-on-error&lt;/code&gt; applies to a single job. If &lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.continue-on-error&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, other jobs in
the matrix will continue running even if the job with &lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.continue-on-error: true&lt;/code&gt; fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.strategy.fail-fast&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.continue-on-error&lt;/code&gt; together. For example, the
following workflow will start four jobs. For each job, continue-on-error is determined by the value of
&lt;code&gt;matrix.experimental&lt;/code&gt;. If any of the jobs with &lt;code&gt;continue-on-error: false&lt;/code&gt; fail, all jobs that are in progress or queued
will be cancelled. If the job with &lt;code&gt;continue-on-error: true&lt;/code&gt; fails, the other jobs will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    continue-on-error: ${{ matrix.experimental }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: true
      matrix:
        version: [6, 7, 8]
        experimental: [false]
        include:
          - version: 9
            experimental: true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Configuring the Maximum Number of Concurrent Jobs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, GitHub will maximize the number of jobs run in parallel depending on runner availability. To set the maximum
number of jobs that can run simultaneously when using a &lt;code&gt;matrix&lt;/code&gt; job strategy, use
&lt;code&gt;jobs.&amp;lt;job_id&amp;gt;.strategy.max-parallel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the following workflow will run a maximum of two jobs at a time, even if there are runners available to run
all six jobs at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      max-parallel: 2
      matrix:
        version: [10, 12, 14]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build and Push Docker Images through GitHub Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On every push to GitHub, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images&quot;&gt;GitHub Action&lt;/a&gt; can
auto-trigger the docker image build and push to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com&quot;&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;. We will be able to see that each
push results in a usable image, which enhances the quality of a docker image a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Generate Docker Hub Access Token&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, ensure you can access &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt; from any workflows you create. To do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add your Docker ID as a secret to GitHub. Navigate to your GitHub repository and click &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Secrets&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt;
&lt;strong&gt;New secret&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new secret with the name DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and your Docker ID as value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new Personal Access Token (PAT). To create a new token, go to Docker Hub Settings at
&lt;code&gt;https://hub.docker.com/settings/security&lt;/code&gt; and then click &lt;strong&gt;New Access Token&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Define CI Workflow on GitHub&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt; the branch that contains the docker image definition, i.e. Dockerfile, and add a new YAML file to the
following path&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;github-repo&amp;gt;/.github/workflows/&amp;lt;workflow-name&amp;gt;.yml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The YAML file should contain the following workflow definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;docker-image-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; below accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Builds and pushes XXX image to Docker Hub

    steps:
      -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683  # v4.2.2

        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
      -

        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          {% raw %}
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
          {% endraw %}
      -
        name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:

          {% raw %}
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/&amp;lt;docker-image-name&amp;gt;:latest
          {% endraw %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push the YAML file onto GitHub. Every push to that branch afterwards will trigger the image build and push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Build Status Badge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate real-time badge on image build status, we could use an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge&quot;&gt;approach&lt;/a&gt;
that GitHub supports out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software Artifactory with Nexus 3 Repository Manager OSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of different repository formats and tools accessing them as well as the emergence of more publicly
available repositories has triggered the need to manage access and usage of these repositories and the components they
contain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting our private repositories for internal components has proven to be a very efficient methodology to exchange
components during all phases of the software development lifecycle. It is considered a best practice at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task of managing all the repositories a development teams interact with can be supported by the use of a dedicated
server application - a &lt;strong&gt;repository manager&lt;/strong&gt;. To put it simply, a repository manager provides two core features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the ability of proxying a remote repository and cache components saving both bandwidth and time required to
retrieve a software component from a remote repository repeatedly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the ability of hosting a repository providing an organization with a deployment target for internal software
components&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Source Code Management (SCM) tools are designed to manage source code, repository managers have been designed to
manage and trace external dependencies and components generated by internal build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository managers are an essential part of any enterprise or open-source software development effort and they enable
greater collaboration between developers and wider distribution of software by facilitating the exchange and usage of
binary components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we install a repository manager, we are bringing the power of a repository like the Central Repository into our
organization. We can use it to proxy the Central Repositories and other repositories, and host our own repositories for
internal and external use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the two aforementioned core features, a repository manager can support the following use cases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows us to manage binary software components through the software development lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;search and catalogue software components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;control component releases with rules and add automated notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;integrate with external security systems, such as LDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manage component metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;control access to components and repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;display component dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brose component archive contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a repository manager provides a number of benefits, including&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved software build performance due to faster component download off the local repository manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduced bandwidth usage due to component caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher predictability and scalability due to limited dependency on external repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased understanding of component usage due to centralized storage of all used components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simplified developer configuration due to central access configuration to remote repositories and components on the
repository manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unified method to provide components to consumer reducing complexity overheads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved collaboration due to the simplified exchange of binary components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!--truncate--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;System Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Memory Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements assume there are no other significant memory hungry processes running on the same host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;____&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JVM Heap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JVM Direct&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host Physical/RAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;__Minimum ( default ) __&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2703MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2703MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8GB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4GB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(host physical/RAM * 2/3) - JVM max heap&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;no limit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disk Space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Directory&lt;/strong&gt; - The size of this directory varies slightly each release. It currently around 330 MB. It is
normal to have multiple application directories installed on the same host over time as repository manager is upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Directory&lt;/strong&gt; - On first start, repository manager creates the base files needed to operate. The bulk of disk
space will be held by our deployed and proxied artifacts, as well as any search indexes. This is highly installation
specific, and will be dependent on the repository formats used, the number of artifacts stored, the size of our teams
and projects, etc.  It&apos;s best to plan for a lot though, formats like Docker and Maven can use very large amounts of
storage (500Gb easily).  &lt;strong&gt;When available disk space drops below 4GB the database will switch to read-only mode&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nexus Repository Manager OSS is all about working with &lt;strong&gt;components&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;repositories&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A component is a resource like a library or a framework that is used as part of a software application at run-time,
integration or unit test execution time or required as part of build process. It could be an entire application or a
static resource like an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically these components are archives of a large variety of files, such as Java bytecode in class files, text files,
or binary files such as images, PDFs, and music files. The archives have numerous formats such as JAR, WAR, ZIP, NPM
packages, or .sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components can be composed of multiple, nested components themselves. For example, consider a Java web application
packaged as a WAR component. It contains a number of JAR components and a number of JavaScript libraries. All of these
are standalone components in other contexts and happend to be included as part of the WAR component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components provide all the building blocks and features that allow a development team to create powerful applications
by assembling them and adding their own business related components to create a full-fledged, powerful application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components, in other tool-chains, are called artifacts, packages, bundles, archives, and other terms. The concept and
idea, however, remain the same and component is used as the independent, generic term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wide variety of components exists and more are continuously created by the open source community as well as
proprietary vendors. These are libraries and frameworks written in various languages on different platforms that are
used for application development every day. It has become a default pattern to build applications by combining the
features of multiple components with our own custom components containing our application code to create an application
for a specific domain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to ease the consumption and usage of components, they are aggregated into collection of components. These are
called &lt;strong&gt;repositories&lt;/strong&gt; and are typically available on the internet as a service. On different platforms terms such as
registry and others are used for the same concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples for such repositories are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Central Repository, also known as Maven Central&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the NuGet Gallery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RubyGems.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;npmjs.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components in these repositories are accessed by numerous tools including&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;package managers like npm, nuget or gem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build tools such as Maven, Gradle, rake or grunt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IDE&apos;s such as Eclipse and IntelliJ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Repository Format&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different repositories use different technologies to store and expose the components in them to client tools. This
defines a repository format and as such is closely related to the tools interacting with the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Maven repository format relies on a specific directory structure defined by the identifiers of the
components and a number of XML formatted files for metadata. Component interaction is performed via plain HTTP commands
and some additional custom interaction with the XML files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other repositories formats use database for storage and REST API interactions, or different directory structures wit
format specific files for the metadata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repository Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve seen that repositories are the containers for the components provided to our users. Creating and managing
repositories is an essential part of our Nexus Repository configuration, since it allows us to expose more components
to our users. It supports proxy repositories, hosted repositories and repository groups in a number of different
repository formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::info&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To manage repositories select the &lt;strong&gt;Repositories&lt;/strong&gt; item in the Repository sub menu of the &lt;strong&gt;Administration&lt;/strong&gt; menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binary parts of a repository are stored in &lt;strong&gt;blob stores&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be configured by selecting Blob Stores from
the Repository sub menu of the Administration menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Repository Types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Proxy Repository&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A repository with the type proxy, also known as a proxy repository, is a repository that is linked to a remote
repository&lt;/strong&gt;. Any request for a component is verified against the local content of the proxy repository. If no local
component is found, the request is forwarded to the remote repository. The component is then retrieved and stored
locally in the repository manager, which acts as a cache. Subsequent requests for the same component are then fulfilled
from the local storage, therefore eliminating the network bandwidth and time overhead of retrieving the component from
the remote repository again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the repository manager ships with the following configured proxy repositories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;maven-central&lt;/strong&gt; This proxy repository accesses the Central Repository, formerly known as Maven Central. It is the
default component repository built into Apache Maven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nuget.org-proxy&lt;/strong&gt; This proxy repository accesses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuget.org/&quot;&gt;NuGet Gallery&lt;/a&gt;. It is the default
component repository used by the &lt;code&gt;nuget&lt;/code&gt; package management tool used for .Net development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hosted Repository&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A repository with the type hosted, also known as a &lt;strong&gt;hosted repository&lt;/strong&gt;, is a repository that stores components in the
repository manager as the authoritative location for these components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the repository manager ships with the following configured hosted repositories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;maven-releases&lt;/strong&gt; This hosted repository uses the maven2 repository format with a release version policy. It is
intended to be the repository where an organization publishes internal releases. We can also use this repository for
third-party components that are not available in external repositories and can therefore not be retrieved via a
configured proxy repository. Examples of these components could be commercial, proprietary libraries such as an
Oracle
JDBC driver that may be referenced by the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;maven-snapshots&lt;/strong&gt; This hosted repository uses the maven2 repository format with a snapshot version policy. It is
intended to be the repository where the organization publishes internal development versions, also known as
snapshots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nuget-hosted&lt;/strong&gt;  This hosted repository is where the organization can publish internal releases in repository using
the nuget repository format. We can also use this repository for third-party components that are not available in
external repositories, that could potentially be proxied to gain access to the components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Repository Group&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A repository with the type group, also known as &lt;strong&gt;repository group&lt;/strong&gt;, represents a powerful feature of Nexus Repository
Manager. They allow us to combine multiple repositories and other repository groups in a single repository. This in
turn means that our users can rely on a single URL for their configuration needs, while the administrators can add more
repositories and therefore components to the repository group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user is given a privilege to a group repository, then that user will also have that privilege to all transitive
members of that group repository &lt;strong&gt;only when their request is directed to the group repository&lt;/strong&gt;. Direct requests to
individual member repositories will only work if the user is given explicit permission to the individual repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository manager ships with the following groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;maven-public&lt;/strong&gt; The maven-public group is a repository group of maven2 formatted repositories and combines the
important &lt;strong&gt;external proxy repository for the Central Repository&lt;/strong&gt; with the hosted repositories &lt;strong&gt;maven-releases&lt;/strong&gt;
and maven-snapshots. This allows us to &lt;em&gt;expose the components of the Central Repository as well as our internal
components in one single, simple-to-use repository&lt;/em&gt; and therefore URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nuget-group&lt;/strong&gt; This group combines the nuget formatted repositories nuget-hosted and nuget.org-proxy into a single
repository for .Net development with NuGet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Managing Repositories and Repository Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Setting Up Maven Repositories&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically Nexus Repository Manager started as a repository manager supporting the Maven repository format and it
continues to include excellent support for users of Apache Maven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maven Repository Format Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Maven repository format and associated concepts and ideas allows us to grasp some of the details and
intricacies involved with different tools and repository formats, that will help us appreciate the need for
repository management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maven developers are familiar with the concept of a repository, since repositories are used by default. The primary
type of a binary component in a Maven format repository is a JAR file containing Java byte-code. This is due to the
Java background of Maven and the fact that the default component type is a JAR. Practically however, there is no limit
to what type of component can be stored in a Maven repository. For example, we can easily deploy WAR or EAR files,
source archives, Flash libraries and applications, Android archives or applications or Ruby libraries to a Maven
repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every software component is described by an XML document called a Project Object Model (POM). This POM contains
information that describes a project and lists a project’s dependencies - the binary software components, which a given
component depends upon for successful compilation or execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Maven downloads a component like a dependency or a plugin from a repository, it also downloads that component&apos;s
POM. &lt;em&gt;Given a component&apos;s POM, Maven can then download any other components that are required by that component&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maven, which interacts with a Maven repository to search for binary software components, model the projects they manage
and retrieve software components on-demand from a repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Central Repository&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we download and install Maven without any customization, it retrieves components from the Central Repository. It
serves millions of Maven users every single day. It is the default, built-in repository using the Maven repository
format and is &lt;em&gt;managed by Sonatype&lt;/em&gt;. We can also view statistics about the size of the Central Repository
&lt;a href=&quot;https://search.maven.org/stats&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central Repository is the largest repository for Java-based components. It can be easily used from other build
tools as well. One can look at the Central Repository as an example of how Maven repositories operate and how they are
assembled. Here are some of the properties of release repositories such as the Central Repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Component Metadata&lt;/strong&gt; All software components added to the Central Repository require proper metadata, including a
Project Object Model (POM) for each component that describes the component itself and any dependencies that software
component might have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release Stability&lt;/strong&gt; Once published to the Central Repository, a component and the metadata describing that
component never change. This property of a release repository, like the Central Repository,  guarantees that
projects that depend on releases will be repeatable and stable over time. While new software components are being
published every day, once a component is assigned a release number on the Central Repository, there is a strict
policy against modifying the contents of a software component after a release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Component Security&lt;/strong&gt; The Central Repository contains cryptographic hashes and PGP signatures that can be used to
verify the authenticity and integrity of software components served and supports connections in a secure manner via
&lt;strong&gt;HTTPS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt; The Central Repository is exposed to the users globally via a high performance content delivery
network of servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Central Repository, there are a number of major organizations, such as Red Hat, Oracle or the Apache
Software foundation, which maintain separate additional repositories. Best practice to facilitate these available
repositories with Nexus Repository Manager OSS is to proxy and cache the contents on our own network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Component Coordinates and the Repository Format&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Component coordinates create a unique identifier for a component. Maven coordinates use the following values: groupId,
artifactId, version, and packaging. This set of coordinates is often referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;GAV coordinate&lt;/strong&gt;, which is
short for Group, Artifact, Version coordinate. The GAV coordinate standard is the foundation for Maven&apos;s ability to
manage dependencies. Four elements of this coordinate system are described below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;groupId&lt;/strong&gt; A group identifier groups a set of components into a logical group. Groups are often designed to reflect
the &lt;strong&gt;organization&lt;/strong&gt; under which a particular software component is being produced. For example, software components
produced by the Maven project at the Apache Software Foundation are available under the groupId &quot;org.apache.maven&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;artifactId&lt;/strong&gt; An artifactId is an identifier for a software component and should be a descriptive name. The
combination of groupId and artifactId must be unique for a specific project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;version&lt;/strong&gt; The version of a project ideally follows the established convention of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://semver.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;semantic versioning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For example, if our simple-library component has a major release
version of 1, a minor release version of 2 and point release version of 3, the version would be 1.2.3. Versions can
also have &lt;strong&gt;alphanumeric qualifiers&lt;/strong&gt; which are often used to denote release status. An example of such a qualifier
would be a version like &quot;1.2.3-BETA&quot; where BETA signals a stage of testing meaningful to consumers of a software
component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;packaging&lt;/strong&gt; Maven was initially created to handle JAR files, but a Maven repository is completely agnostic about
the type of component it is managing. Packaging can be anything that describes any binary software format including:
zip, nar, war, ear, sar and aar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools designed to interact Maven repositories translate component coordinates into a URL which corresponds to a
location in a Maven repository. If a tool such as Maven is looking for version &quot;1.2.0&quot; of the &quot;commons-lang&quot; JAR in
the group &quot;org.apache.commons&quot;, this request is translated into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;repoURL&amp;gt;/org/apache/commons/commons-lang/1.2.0/commons-lang-1.2.0.jar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maven also downloads the corresponding POM for &quot;commons-lang 1.2.0&quot; from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;repoURL&amp;gt;/org/apache/commons/commons-lang/1.2.0/commons-lang-1.2.0.pom
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This POM may contain references to other components, which are then retrieved from the same repository using the same
URL patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Release and Snapshot Repositories&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Maven repository stores two types of components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release repositories&lt;/strong&gt; are for stable, static release components. A release component is a component which was
created by a specific, versioned release. For example, consider the &quot;1.2.0&quot; release of the &quot;commons-lang&quot; library
stored in the Central Repository. This release component, &quot;commons-lang-1.2.0.jar&quot;, and the associated POM,
&quot;commons-lang-1.2.0.pom&quot;, are static objects which will never change in the Central Repository. Released components
are considered to be solid, stable and perpetual in order to guarantee that builds which depend upon them are
repeatable over time. The released JAR component is associated with a PGP signature, an MD5, and a SHA check-sum
which can be used to verify both the authenticity and integrity of the binary software component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snapshot repositories&lt;/strong&gt; are frequently updated repositories that store binary software components from projects
under constant development. Snapshot components are components generated during the development of a software
project. A Snapshot component has both a version number such as &quot;1.3.0&quot; or &quot;1.3&quot; and a timestamp in its name. For
example, a snapshot component for &quot;commons-lang 1.3.0&quot; might have the name
&quot;commons-lang-1.3.0.-20090314.182342-1.jar&quot;. The associated POM, MD5 and SHA hashes would also have a similar name.
To facilitate collaboration during the development of software components, Maven and other clients that know how to
consume snapshot components from a repository also know how to interrogate the metadata associated with a Snapshot
component to retrieve the latest version of a Snapshot dependency from a repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While it is possible to create a repository which serves both release and snapshot components, repositories are
usually segmented into release or snapshot repositories serving different consumers and maintaining different standards
and procedures for deploying components&lt;/strong&gt;. Much like the difference between networks, a release repository is considered
like a production network and a snapshot repository is more like a development or a testing network. While there is a
higher level of procedure and ceremony associated with deploying to a release repository, snapshot components can be
deployed and changed frequently without regard for stability and repeatability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::info&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A project under active development produces snapshot components that change over time. A release is comprised of
components which will remain unchanged over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Version policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every repository has one of the 3 &lt;strong&gt;version policies&lt;/strong&gt; configured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release&lt;/strong&gt; A Maven repository can be configured to be suitable for release components with the Release version
policy. The Central Repository uses a release version policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snapshot&lt;/strong&gt; Continuous development is typically performed with snapshot versions supported by the Snapshot version
policy. These version values have to &lt;strong&gt;end with -SNAPSHOT in the POM file&lt;/strong&gt;. This allows repeated uploads where the
actual number used is composed of a date/timestamp and an enumerator and the retrieval can still use the -SNAPSHOT
version string. The repository manager and client tools manage the metadata files that manage this translation from
the snapshot version to the timestamp value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed&lt;/strong&gt; The Mixed version policy allows us to support both approaches within one repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hosting Maven Repositories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hosted Maven repository can be used to deploy our own as well as third-party components. A default installation of
Nexus Repository Manager includes two hosted Maven repositories. The &lt;strong&gt;maven-releases&lt;/strong&gt; repository uses a release
version policy and the &lt;strong&gt;maven-snapshots&lt;/strong&gt; repository uses a snapshot version policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Deploying to Hosted Maven repository&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment to a repository is configured in 2 steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#configuring-repository-in-maven-project&quot;&gt;Have Maven project point to the repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#obtaining-push-access-to-repository&quot;&gt;Authenticate push access to the repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Configuring Repository in Maven Project&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment to a repository is configured in the  &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt; for the respective project in the &quot;distributionManagement&quot;
section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;project&amp;gt;
   ...

    &amp;lt;distributionManagement&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;nexus&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;Releases&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;https://nexus-host/repository/maven-releases&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;snapshotRepository&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- This repository can be omitted --&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;nexus&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;Snapshot&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;https://nexus-host/repository/maven-snapshots&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/snapshotRepository&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/distributionManagement&amp;gt;

   ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace the &lt;code&gt;nexus-host&lt;/code&gt; with the NDS address pointing to the actual Nexus instance and
&lt;code&gt;maven-releases&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;maven-snapshots&lt;/code&gt; to the actual repository name. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;distributionManagement&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;nexus&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;Releases&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;https://nexus.paion-data.dev/repository/maven-oss&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/distributionManagement&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Snapshot&quot; repository (tagged &lt;code&gt;snapshotRepository&lt;/code&gt; above) can be omitted in the most CI/CD-enabled project team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Obtaining Push Access to Repository&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credentials used for the deployment are configured in the &quot;server&quot; section of the &lt;code&gt;settings.xml&lt;/code&gt; file. In the
example below server contains &quot;nexus&quot; as the id, along with a &quot;headless user&apos;s&quot; username and password. They are the
credentials needed to authenticate against the repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;settings&amp;gt;
...

    &amp;lt;servers&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;server&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;nexus&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;some-headless-username&amp;lt;/username&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;password&amp;gt;some-headless-password&amp;lt;/password&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/server&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/servers&amp;gt;

...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to grant the user above (i.e. &quot;some-headless-username&quot;) the push access on the repository side in the
following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href=&quot;#content-selectors&quot;&gt;content selector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href=&quot;#privileges&quot;&gt;privilege&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href=&quot;#roles&quot;&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign role to &lt;a href=&quot;#users&quot;&gt;the headless user&lt;/a&gt; defined above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full build of project, including downloading the declared dependencies and uploading the build output to the
repository manager, can now be invoked with &lt;code&gt;mvn clean deploy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Deploying to Hosted Maven Repository via CI/CD (e.g. GitHub Actions)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we deployed in the last minute our artifact to repository through a manual &lt;code&gt;mvn clean deploy&lt;/code&gt; command. To
enable automatic deployment to the repository, we will simply go through
&lt;a href=&quot;#deploying-to-hosted-maven-repository-manually&quot;&gt;the exact same procedure&lt;/a&gt; except that instead of running
&lt;code&gt;mvn clean deploy&lt;/code&gt; locally and manually, we let CI/CD execute that for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Up-version Automatically&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that a standard release repository does not allow an artifacts with a defined version to be pushed
into it twice. For example, if our artifacts is my-artifact-1.1.2.jar, this JAR, with version 1.1.2, will fail to be
published onto the repository the 2nd time unless we delete the version 1.1.2 up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to bump the artifact version each time we release. We achieve this using GitHub&apos;s tagging system. The
two scripts below, taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yahoo/fili/tree/master/screwdriver&quot;&gt;Yahoo/fili&apos;s CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;, creates a new
tag based on previous release tag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tag-for-release.bash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash

# Pick up the tags from the adjusted remote
git fetch --unshallow
git fetch --tags

echo $(git branch -v)

# Get the last tag on this branch
LAST_TAG=$(git describe)
echo &quot;INFO Last tag: $LAST_TAG&quot;

# Build the new tag to push
NEW_TAG=$(LAST_TAG=${LAST_TAG} python .github/upversion.py)
echo &quot;INFO Creating tag: $NEW_TAG&quot;
git tag $NEW_TAG -a -m &quot;Autogenerated version bump tag&quot;

# Push the new tag
echo &quot;INFO Pushing tag: $NEW_TAG&quot;
git push origin $NEW_TAG
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;upversion.py&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/python

import os

split_tag = (os.environ[&apos;LAST_TAG&apos;].split(&apos;-&apos;)[0]).split(&quot;.&quot;)
split_tag[-1] = str(int(split_tag[-1]) + 1)
print(&quot;.&quot;.join(split_tag))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We put these two files under &lt;strong&gt;.github&lt;/strong&gt; directory&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this file differs from the &lt;a href=&quot;#deploying-to-github-packageshttpsgithubcomfeaturespackages&quot;&gt;GitHub version&lt;/a&gt; by
replacing the &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; with the dedicated credentials put in a dynamically generated settints.xml file using
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/whelk-io/maven-settings-xml-action&quot;&gt;whelk-io/maven-settings-xml-action&lt;/a&gt; action. These
credentials are sealed securely in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets&quot;&gt;GitHub Secrets&lt;/a&gt;. We need to define the following 3 secrets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAVEN_DEPLOY_SERVER_ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAVEN_DEPLOY_SERVER_USERNAME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can later pull our released artifact from the hosted repository by placing the &lt;strong&gt;repository&lt;/strong&gt; section. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;project&amp;gt;

    ...

    &amp;lt;repositories&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;paion&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;Paion Data Official Release Repository&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;https://nexus.paion-data.dev/repository/maven-oss&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/repositories&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/project&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Using Repository Manager with Apache Maven&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use repository manager with &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Maven&lt;/a&gt;, configure Maven to check the repository manager
instead of the default, built-in connection to the Central Repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, we add a mirror configuration and override the default configuration for the central repository in our
&quot;~/.m2/settings.xml&quot;, shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace the &quot;nexus-host&quot; with the NDS address pointing to the actual Nexus instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;settings&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;mirrors&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;mirror&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!--This sends everything else to /public --&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;nexus&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;mirrorOf&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/mirrorOf&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;https://nexus-host/repository/maven-public/&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/mirror&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/mirrors&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;profiles&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;profile&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;nexus&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!--Enable snapshots for the built in central repo to direct --&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!--all requests to nexus via the mirror --&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;repositories&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;central&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;http://central&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;releases&amp;gt;&amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/releases&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;snapshots&amp;gt;&amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/snapshots&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/repositories&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;pluginRepositories&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;pluginRepository&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;central&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;http://central&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;releases&amp;gt;&amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/releases&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;snapshots&amp;gt;&amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/snapshots&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/pluginRepository&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/pluginRepositories&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/profile&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/profiles&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;activeProfiles&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;!--make the profile active all the time --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;activeProfile&amp;gt;nexus&amp;lt;/activeProfile&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/activeProfiles&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/settings&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the configuration above, a single profile called &lt;strong&gt;nexus&lt;/strong&gt; is defined. It configures a repository and a
pluginRepository with the id &lt;strong&gt;central&lt;/strong&gt; that overrides the same repositories in the Super POM. The &lt;em&gt;Super POM&lt;/em&gt; is
internal to every Apache Maven install and establishes default values. These overrides are important since they change
the repositories by enabling snapshots and replacing the URL with a bogus URL. This URL is overridden by the &lt;strong&gt;mirror&lt;/strong&gt;
setting in the same settings.xml file to point to the URL of our single repository group. This repository group can,
therefore, contain release as well as snapshot components and Maven will pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, The &lt;strong&gt;mirrorOf&lt;/strong&gt; pattern of &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; causes any repository request to be redirected to this mirror and to our
single repository group, which in the example is the public group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to use other patterns in the &quot;mirrorOf&quot; field. A possible valuable setting is to use &lt;strong&gt;external:&lt;/strong&gt;*.
This matches all repositories except those using &quot;localhost&quot; or file based repositories. This is used in conjunction
with a repository manager when you want to exclude redirecting repositories that are defined for integration testing.
The integration test runs for Apache Maven itself require this setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More documentation about mirror settings can be found in the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html&quot;&gt;mini guide on the Maven web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For startup who doesn&apos;t really need to proxy the entire Maven Central at the moment, another approach is to set up
multiple repositories. In each project they are working on, they will still fetch everything from Maven Central except
for their hosted component from Nexus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different ways that we can specify the use of multiple repositories. The first way is to specify in a POM
which repositories we want to use. That is supported both inside and outside of build profiles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;project&amp;gt;
    ...

    &amp;lt;repositories&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;my-repo1&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;your custom repo&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;my-repo2&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;your custom repo&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/repositories&amp;gt;

    ...
&amp;lt;/project&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way we can specify multiple repositories is by creating a profile in the &lt;code&gt;${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml&lt;/code&gt; file like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;settings&amp;gt;
    ...
    &amp;lt;profiles&amp;gt;
        ...
        &amp;lt;profile&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;myprofile&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;repositories&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;
                    &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;my-repo2&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;
                    &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;your custom repo&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;
                    &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/repositories&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/profile&amp;gt;
        ...
    &amp;lt;/profiles&amp;gt;

     &amp;lt;activeProfiles&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;activeProfile&amp;gt;myprofile&amp;lt;/activeProfile&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;/activeProfiles&amp;gt;
     ...
&amp;lt;/settings&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we specify repositories in profiles we must remember to activate that particular profile. As we can see above we do
this by registering a profile to be active in the &lt;code&gt;activeProfiles&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could also activate this profile on the command like by executing the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mvn -Pmyprofile ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact the &lt;code&gt;-P&lt;/code&gt; option will take a CSV list of profiles to activate if we wish to activate multiple profiles
simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settings descriptor documentation can be found on the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/maven-settings/settings.html&quot;&gt;Maven Local Settings Model Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote repository URLs are queried in the following order for artifacts until one returns a valid result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global settings.xml&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User settings.xml&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local pom.xml&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parent POMs, recursively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super POM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;effective POMs from dependency path to the artifact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of these locations, the repositories within the profiles are queried first in the order outlined at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html&quot;&gt;Introduction to build profiles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before downloading from a repository,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html&quot;&gt;mirrors configuration&lt;/a&gt; is applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective settings and local build POM, with profile taken into account, can easily be reviewed to see their
repositories order with &lt;code&gt;mvn help:effective-settings&lt;/code&gt; and mvn &lt;code&gt;help:effective-pom -Dverbose&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting Up Docker Registry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker containers and their usage have revolutionized the way applications and the underlying operating system are
packaged and deployed to development, testing and production systems. The creation of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://opencontainers.org/&quot;&gt;Open Container Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, and the involvement of a large number of stakeholders,
guarantees that the ecosystem of tools around the lightweight containers and their usage will continue to flourish.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt; is the original registry for Docker container images and it is being joined by
more and more other publicly available registries such as the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/&quot;&gt;Google Container Registry&lt;/a&gt; and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexus Repository Manager OSS support Docker registries as the Docker repository format for &lt;strong&gt;hosted&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;proxy&lt;/strong&gt;
repositories. We can expose these repositories to the client-side tools directly or as a
&lt;a href=&quot;#repository-group&quot;&gt;repository group&lt;/a&gt;, which is a repository that merges and exposes the contents of multiple
repositories in one convenient URL. This allows us to reduce time and bandwidth usage for accessing Docker images in a
registry as well as share our images within our organization in a hosted repository. Users can then launch containers
based on those images, resulting in a completely private Docker registry with all the features available in the
repository manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Docker Port Scalability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Docker client has strict requirements about how it can retrieve content from a repository (i.e., a registry). These
requirements mainly center around the path at which it expects everything to be hosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is possible to tell the Docker client to use a chosen host from which to retrieve (or to which to upload)
images, it is not possible to tell it to use an arbitrary base path where images are stored in a registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further explain, the Docker client is given a registry to contact by specifying only the hostname + port. It&apos;s also
given a specific path to an image in that registry. So, for example, it would be given
&lt;code&gt;example:443/some/custom/image&lt;/code&gt; to specify an image. We are not able to specify a registry application path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexus Repository exposes its Docker registries with a repository path of &lt;code&gt;/repository/&amp;lt;repo_name&amp;gt;/&lt;/code&gt; and, by default,
and application context path of &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a full Docker image in the repository &quot;docker-hosted&quot; might be accessible at full URL
&quot;example:443/nexus3/repository/docker-hosted/some/custom/image&quot;, which can be broken down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;example.com&lt;/strong&gt; = host name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;443&lt;/strong&gt; = port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/nexus3 = application context path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/repository/docker-hosted = base registry path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/some/custom/image&lt;/strong&gt; = specific image path in the registry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way to give the Docker client the application context path or base registry path. Docker needs the registry
exposed at the root of the host + port that it is accessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important because Nexus Repository uses request paths to separate content between different repositories. There
are a few potential ways to overcome this Docker limitation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexus Repository uses &lt;strong&gt;role-based access control&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;RBAC&lt;/strong&gt;) to give administrators fine-grained control over user
rights to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the Nexus Repository web application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read access to a component path in a repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administator access to configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish or upload files to a repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default configuration ships with the administrator role and optional anonymous access to browse and read all
repositories. &lt;strong&gt;We should not use the default anonymous role if we need to create protected repositories&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Realms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::info What Is a Realm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A realm is a security policy domain defined for a web or application server. The protected resources on a server can be
partitioned into a set of protection spaces, &lt;strong&gt;each with its own authentication scheme&lt;/strong&gt; and/or authorization database
containing a collection of users and groups.
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realms can be accessed via the &lt;strong&gt;Realms&lt;/strong&gt; menu item located under &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;, in the Administration main menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-realms.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-realms.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively, the configuration shown above determines what authentication realm is used to grant a user access and the
order the realms are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Authenticating Realm and Local Authorizing Realm&lt;/strong&gt; These are the built-in realms used by default. They allow
the repository manager to manage security setup without additional external systems. Sonatype recommends keeping the
Local realms at the top of the active list.  In the event of system recovery, if we have them lower in the order (or
removed), restoration may be more difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Privileges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privileges define actions which can be performed against specific functionality. Privileges can only be assigned to
roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access Privileges go to &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; in the Administration menu, where it&apos;s listed as a sub-section. An extensive
list of privileges is already built in the repository manager and is partially shown in the figure below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-privileges-partial-list.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-privileges-partial-list.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature allows us to inspect existing privileges and create custom privileges as required. Users will need
&lt;em&gt;nx-privilege&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;nx-all&lt;/em&gt; privileges to access this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Privilege Names&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Names are unique identifiers. Privileges included by default are prefixed with &lt;strong&gt;nx-&lt;/strong&gt; . Privileges that are migrated
from Nexus Repository 2 will be named as they were in Repository 2. Privileges that we create ourselves can only
consist of letters, digits, underscores(&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;), hyphens(&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;), and dots(&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;). A privilege name cannot start with an
underscore or dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For custom privileges, it is encouraged that we use a &lt;strong&gt;simple convention&lt;/strong&gt; to namespace our privileges. For example
using a simple acronym representing our organization name. &quot;Example Organization Inc.&quot; could prefix its privilege names
with &lt;strong&gt;eoi-&lt;/strong&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Privilege Types&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The privilege list displays an icon for the privilege Type as the first column in the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::info Privilege Permissions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privilege permissions are represented by a colon separated list of text segments, where each segment can be one of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a single text value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a comma separated list of text values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an asterisk character * to represent all values in that segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal segment matching algorithm uses
&lt;a href=&quot;https://shiro.apache.org/permissions.html&quot;&gt;Apache Shiro wildcard permissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;application (&lt;code&gt;nexus:{name}:{actions}&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicable Actions: create, read, update, delete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description: Application type privileges are most commonly the built-in privileges that control access to specific
product feature areas in the Administration &lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, &quot;nexus:blobstores:create,read&quot; means allowing for
creating and reading blobstores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;repository-admin (&lt;code&gt;nexus:repository-admin:{format}:{repository}:{actions}&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicable Actions: browse,read,edit,add,delete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description: Repository Admin privileges control administration of &lt;strong&gt;configuration&lt;/strong&gt; for specific repositories or
repository formats. For example, &quot;nexus:repository-admin:nuget:nuget.org-proxy:browse,read&quot; means allowing viewing
of the repository configuration for the nuget format repository named &quot;nuget.org-proxy&quot;. &lt;strong&gt;These privileges do not
control access to repository content&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;repository-content-selector (&lt;code&gt;nexus:repository-content-selector:{selector}:{format}:{repository}:{actions}&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicable Actions: browse,read,edit,add,delete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description: Repository Content Selector privileges provide fine-grained control over access to content within a
repository by way of a content selector. For example, &quot;nexus:repository-content-selector:&lt;em&gt;:maven2:&lt;/em&gt;:read&quot; means
allowing a user for read access to any content matching a content selector defined for the maven2 format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;repository-view (&lt;code&gt;nexus:repository-view:{format}:{repository}:{actions}&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicable Actions: browse,read,edit,add,delete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description: Repository View privileges control general access to all content contained within specific
repositories or repository formats. For example, &quot;nexus:repository-view:maven2:central:browse,read&quot; means allow
browsing and viewing content within the maven2 format repository named central. &lt;strong&gt;These privileges do not allow
changing configuration of a repository&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;script (&lt;code&gt;nexus:script:{script name}:{actions}&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicable Actions: browse,read,edit,add,delete,run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description: Script privileges control access to using the Groovy Script related REST APIs as documented in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/integrations/rest-and-integration-api&quot;&gt;REST and Integration API&lt;/a&gt; . These
privileges do not control general REST API access. For example, &quot;nexus:script:*:read&quot; means allowing for read access
to all scripts of any name. &quot;nexus:script:my-uploaded-script:run&quot; means allowing the calling user for running
(executing) the script named my-uploaded-script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wildcard (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicable Actions: *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description: Wildcard privileges allow one to build a privilege string using a free-form series of segments. All
other privilege types are more specific segment forms of a wildcard privilege. There is only one wildcard privilege
included by default named &lt;strong&gt;nx-all&lt;/strong&gt; with permission &lt;strong&gt;nexus:&lt;/strong&gt;*  that gives access to all functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::info Privilege Actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions are functions allowing an explicit behavior the privilege can perform with the associated function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Actions to choose from are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt; allows privileges to add repositories or scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt; allows privileges to view various configuration lists and scripts. Without &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt;, any associated action
will permit a privilege to see these lists but not its contents. The &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt; action also allows privileges to
utilize tools that can look at content from the command line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;browse&lt;/strong&gt;  allows privileges to view the contents of associated repositories. Unlike &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt;, privilege types with
browse can only view and administrate repository &lt;em&gt;contents&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;UI&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create&lt;/strong&gt; allows privileges to create applicable configurations within the repository manager. Since a &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt;
permission is required to view a configuration, this action is associated with most existing create privileges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;delete&lt;/strong&gt; allows privileges to delete repository manager configurations, repository contents, and scripts. A
&lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt; action is generally associated with delete actions, so the actor can view these configurations to remove
them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt; allows privileges to modify associated scripts, repository content, and repository administration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update&lt;/strong&gt; allows privileges to update repository manager configurations. Most existing privileges with update
include &lt;strong&gt;read&lt;/strong&gt; actions. Therefore, if creating custom privileges with update, the actor should consider adding read
to the privilege in order to view repository manager configuration updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the wildcard, gives us the ability to group all actions together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must assign a single or combination of comma-delimited actions when creating new privileges. The privilege type to
which we apply any of these Actions will perform the action&apos;s implied behavior. Consider how each action behaves when
applied to a privilege type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creating a Privilege&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Create privilege&lt;/strong&gt; button to view a list of privilege types&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexnus3-privileges-types.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexnus3-privileges-types.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selecting a type, fill in the required fields and save the privilege. The privilege can be found listed among the
default privileges on the main &lt;strong&gt;Privileges&lt;/strong&gt; screen. We can use the &lt;strong&gt;Filter&lt;/strong&gt; input box to find a specific
privilege. In the following example, an &lt;em&gt;Application&lt;/em&gt; privilege type is created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-privileges-application.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-privileges-application.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form provides Name, Description, Domain, and Actions in figure above. The form is completed for a privilege that
allows read access to the LDAP administration. If assigned this privilege, a user is able to view LDAP administration
configuration but not edit it, create a new LDAP configuration, nor delete any existing LDAP configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another example, a &lt;em&gt;Repository View&lt;/em&gt; privilege type is created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-privileges-repository-view.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-privileges-repository-view.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form provides Name, Description, Format, Repository, and Actions in figure above. The form is completed for a
privilege granting sufficient access to publish images to a specific hosted repository. A user with this privilege can
view and read the contents of the repository as well as publish new images to it, but not delete images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Content Selectors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content selectors provide a means for us to select specific content from all of our content. The content we select is
evaluated against expressions written in &lt;strong&gt;CSEL&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Content Selector Expression Language&lt;/strong&gt;). CSEL is a light version
of &lt;strong&gt;JEXL&lt;/strong&gt; used to script queries along specific paths and coordinates available to our repository manager formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content selectors allow us to define what content users are allowed to access. We can define, in a simplified example,
a selector named &quot;Apache Maven&quot; with a search expression of &lt;code&gt;path =~ &quot;^/org/apache/maven/&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. This would match all
components that start with the designated component path. Another, yet more complete, example would be to &quot;select all
maven2 content along a path that starts with &lt;code&gt;org.apache.commons&lt;/code&gt;&quot;:
&lt;code&gt;format == &quot;maven2&quot; and path =~ &quot;^/org/apache/commons/.*&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creating a Query&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we identify user permissions for our selector, create the query first. Click &lt;strong&gt;Content Selectors&lt;/strong&gt; located in
&lt;strong&gt;Repository&lt;/strong&gt;, from the &lt;strong&gt;Administration&lt;/strong&gt; menu. Click &lt;strong&gt;Create Selector&lt;/strong&gt; to open a new form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-content-selector-example.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-content-selector-example.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can preview our selector and what results it will return by clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Preview&lt;/strong&gt; results button located
somewhere in the middle section of the page. Select a repository or grouping of repositories from the &lt;strong&gt;Preview
Repository&lt;/strong&gt; dropdown and click the &lt;strong&gt;Preview&lt;/strong&gt; button. Assets that match will be returned in the space below the
filter and can be filtered upon if we wish to check on a specific result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we are satisfied with our fields, click &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt; to create the content selector. All saved selector queries we
create will be listed in the &lt;strong&gt;Content Selectors&lt;/strong&gt; screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Finer Access Control with &quot;Content Selector privilege&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our security setup, we can create user permissions to manage the filters we built in the &lt;em&gt;Create Selector&lt;/em&gt;
form. We can add a new privilege that controls operations of read, edit, delete or * (all) for components matching that
selector. The privilege can even span multiple repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new &lt;strong&gt;content selector privilege&lt;/strong&gt;, click &lt;strong&gt;Privileges&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; section of the
&lt;strong&gt;Administration&lt;/strong&gt; panel. Then click the &lt;strong&gt;Create privilege&lt;/strong&gt; button. Locate and click &lt;strong&gt;Repository Content Selector&lt;/strong&gt;
from the list of options in &lt;strong&gt;Select Privilege Type&lt;/strong&gt;. We will see a form that displays the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name: Create a name for the content selector privilege.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description: Add a brief description for the privilege.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content Selector: Use this dropdown to select from a list of selectors we created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repository: Use this dropdown to select from either a range of all repository contents, all repository contents of an
individual format, or repositories created by us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions: Grant read, edit, delete, or * (all) privileges for user access control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete the form, save the new privilege by clicking &lt;strong&gt;Create privilege&lt;/strong&gt;. We can use our new privilege to regulate
what permissible data we want the user to access. We could group all related privileges into a &lt;a href=&quot;#roles&quot;&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;.
Ultimately, we could assign our roles to a &lt;a href=&quot;#users&quot;&gt;user&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Content Selector Query Reference&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the allowable attributes for content selectors that define path and format as values supported by Nexus
Repository Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attribute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allowed Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;format&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The format of the content for which we query&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;path&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The path of our repository content&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valid Operators are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Operator&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Definition&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Example&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Matches text &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;format == &quot;maven2&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;=~&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Matches a Java regular expression pattern&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;path =~ &quot;^/org/apache/commons/.*&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;=^&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Starts with text.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;path =^ &quot;/com/example/&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Match all expressions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;format == &quot;maven2&quot; and path =~ &quot;^/org/apache/commons/.*&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Match any expression&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;format == &quot;maven2&quot; or format == &quot;npm&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;( expr )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Group multiple expressions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[^example]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^example]: &lt;code&gt;format == &quot;npm&quot; or (format == &quot;maven2&quot; and path =~ &quot;^/org/apache/commons/.*&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::info Version Range Regular Expressions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid encountering database errors, we should escape dashes in version range regular expressions. For example,
&lt;code&gt;path =~ &quot;[0-9a-zA-Z\-_]&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing a content selector, remember that the asset&apos;s path will always begin with a leading slash when the
selector is evaluated. This is true even though the leading slash is not displayed when searching or browsing assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Roles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roles aggregate &lt;a href=&quot;#privileges&quot;&gt;privileges&lt;/a&gt; into a related context and can, in turn, be grouped to create more complex
roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository manager ships with a predefined &lt;em&gt;admin&lt;/em&gt; as well as an &lt;em&gt;anonymous role&lt;/em&gt;. These can be inspected in the
&lt;strong&gt;Roles&lt;/strong&gt; feature view accessible via the &lt;strong&gt;Roles&lt;/strong&gt; item in the &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; section of the &lt;strong&gt;Administration&lt;/strong&gt; main
menu. A simple example is shown in figure below. The list displays the &lt;em&gt;Name&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Description&lt;/em&gt; of the role as well as
the &lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;, which displays whether the role is internal (Nexus) or a mapping to an external source like LDAP. In
order to access these functions, a user must have &lt;em&gt;nx-roles&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;nx-all&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#privileges&quot;&gt;privileges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-roles-list.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-roles-list.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new role, click on the &lt;strong&gt;Create Role&lt;/strong&gt; button, select &lt;strong&gt;Nexus role&lt;/strong&gt; and fill out the Role creation feature
view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::info&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use functions of creating, editing and deleting roles, a user without the &lt;em&gt;nx-all&lt;/em&gt; privilege also will need
&lt;em&gt;nx-privilege-read&lt;/em&gt;. This is because the roles page lists privileges on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-roles-create.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-roles-create.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating a new role, we will need to supply a &lt;strong&gt;Role ID&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;Role Name&lt;/strong&gt; and optionally a &lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;.
Roles are comprised of other roles and individual privileges. To assign a role or privilege to a role, drag and drop
the desired privileges from the &lt;em&gt;Available&lt;/em&gt; list to the &lt;em&gt;Given&lt;/em&gt; list under the &lt;em&gt;Privileges&lt;/em&gt; header. We can use the
&lt;strong&gt;Filter&lt;/strong&gt; input to narrow down the list of displayed privileges and the arrow buttons to add or remove privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same functionality is available under the &lt;em&gt;Roles&lt;/em&gt; header to select among the &lt;em&gt;Available&lt;/em&gt; roles and add them to the
list of &lt;em&gt;Contained&lt;/em&gt; roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally press the &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt; button to get the role created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An existing role can be inspected and edited by clicking on the row in the list. This role-specific view allows us to
delete the role with the &lt;strong&gt;Delete&lt;/strong&gt; button. The built-in roles are managed by the repository manager and &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be
edited or deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mapping External Groups to Nexus Roles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to creating an internal role, the &lt;strong&gt;Create Role&lt;/strong&gt; button allows us to create an &lt;strong&gt;External Role Mapping&lt;/strong&gt;
to an external authorization system configured in the repository manager such as LDAP. This is something we would do,
if we want to grant every member of an externally managed group (such as an LDAP group) a number of privileges and
roles in the repository manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, assume that we have a group in LDAP named &quot;scm&quot; and we want to make sure that everyone in that group has
administrative privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;External Role Mapping&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;LDAP&lt;/strong&gt; to see a list of roles managed by that external realm in a dialog. Pick
the desired scm group and confirm by pressing &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For faster access or if we cannot see our group name, we can also type in a portion or the whole name of the group and
it will limit the dropdown to the selected text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the external role has been selected, creates a linked role. We can then assign other roles and privileges to this
new externally mapped role like we would do for any other role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any user that is part of the scm group in LDAP, receives all the privileges defined in the created role allowing us to
adapt our generic role in LDAP to the repository manager-specific use cases we want these users to be allowed to
perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository manager ships with two users by default: &lt;em&gt;admin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;anonymous&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;admin&lt;/em&gt; user has all privileges
and the &lt;em&gt;anonymous&lt;/em&gt; user has read-only privileges. The initial password for the admin user can be found in an
&quot;admin.password&quot; file found in the &lt;code&gt;$data-dir&lt;/code&gt; directory after starting the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Users feature view displayed in figure below can be accessed via the &lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt; item in the &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; section of
the &lt;strong&gt;Administration&lt;/strong&gt; menu. Users must have &lt;em&gt;nx-users&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;nx-all&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#privileges&quot;&gt;privileges&lt;/a&gt; to see this page. On page
load, the security Source of &quot;Local&quot; is selected and represents the local NXRM realm. The filtered list shows the
users&apos; User ID, First Name, Last Name, Email and Status from the security Source selected in the dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-users-list.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-users-list.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on a user in the list or clicking on the &lt;strong&gt;Create local user&lt;/strong&gt; button displays the details view to edit or
create the account shown in figure below. For external users, such as LDAP or Crowd, once we have our external realm
setup we can edit their permissions here as well. Simply select the realm the user is on from the &lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt; dropdown.
Then type the user ID into the field to the right of that dropdown and search for it. Then click on the result desired
to edit, same as a local user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::info&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use functions of creating, editing and deleting users, a user without the &lt;em&gt;nx-all&lt;/em&gt; privilege also will need
&lt;em&gt;nx-roles-read&lt;/em&gt;. This is because the users page lists roles on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-users-create.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-users-create.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;ID&lt;/strong&gt; can be defined upon initial creation and remains fixed thereafter. In addition we can specify the users
&lt;strong&gt;First Name&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Last Name&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Email address&lt;/strong&gt;.  We also must enter and confirm a &lt;strong&gt;Password&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Status allows us to set an account to be &lt;em&gt;Disabled&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Active&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;#roles&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; control allows us to add and
remove defined roles to the user and therefore control the privileges assigned to the user. A user can be assigned one
or more roles that in turn can include references to other roles or to individual privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On edit, we can select &lt;strong&gt;Change Password&lt;/strong&gt; item in the drop down. The password can be changed in a dialog, provided the
user is managed by the built-in security realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Default Role&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Default Role is a role that is automatically granted to all authenticated users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable appending a default role to all authenticated users, navigate to the &lt;strong&gt;Capabilities&lt;/strong&gt; item in the &lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt;
section of the &lt;strong&gt;Administration&lt;/strong&gt; menu; then hit &lt;strong&gt;Create capability&lt;/strong&gt; and choose capability type &lt;strong&gt;Default Role&lt;/strong&gt; as
pictured below; we will then be able to select the role that we want applied to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-default-role.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-default-role.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is saved, the &lt;em&gt;Default Role Realm&lt;/em&gt; will be added to the active list of security realms and start applying the
new role to all authenticated users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This default role is appended to authenticated users dynamically, and will &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; show up as assigned to any user via
the User administration page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&quot;413 Request Entity Too Large&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If deploying, for example, a Maven JAR or Docker image to some Nexus repository results in &quot;413 Request Entity Too
Large&quot; error, that&apos;s due to, in the case of Nginx as reverse proxy in front of the Nexus, our server block having a
default value for &lt;strong&gt;client_max_body_size&lt;/strong&gt; of around 1MB in size when unset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve this, we will need to add the following line to our server block (&lt;code&gt;/etc/nginx/nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus-413-solution.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus-413-solution.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, such as where &quot;client_max_body_size&quot; directive should be placed, please refer to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size&quot;&gt;Nginx documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&quot;400 Repository does not allow updating assets&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version already exists on a release repository. We will need to either bump component version or let Nexus admin
to delete the root folder of that component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&quot;A database error occurred&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we perform some disk I/O related task on UI and we see the following on the top right corner of the page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/nexus3-strange-error.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading nexus3-strange-error.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error itself does not indicate any information about the nature of the error. We will then need to know more
details about the error by going down to the Nexus server log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case Nexus is running as a Docker container, we need to jump into the container first by executing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker exec -it &amp;lt;nexus-container-name&amp;gt; bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;nexus-container-name&lt;/code&gt; can be seen using &lt;code&gt;docker ps -a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The log file we will be looking at, in the case of running inside Docker container, is located at
&lt;code&gt;/nexus-data/log/nexus.log&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</description><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;幽默感并非与生俱来，而是可以逐步培养和提升的。它是一种思维方式和生活态度，能帮助我们更好地应对生活中的挑战，
也能增进人际关系。我们需要循序渐进地培养幽默感&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. 发现并欣赏幽默&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;观察你周围的幽默：&lt;/strong&gt; 留意日常生活中有趣的人、事、物。可能是朋友的一个表情，也可能是一个意外的巧合。开始有意识地寻找生活中的笑点，你会发现它们无处不在。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;多接触幽默内容：&lt;/strong&gt; 观看喜剧电影、脱口秀、综艺节目，阅读幽默书籍或文章，收听有趣的播客。了解不同类型的幽默，找到自己喜欢的风格，并分析它们是如何达到幽默效果的（比如夸张、反转、讽刺、双关语等）。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;留意别人的幽默感：&lt;/strong&gt; 观察那些你觉得很有趣的人，他们是如何运用幽默的？他们的幽默感是来源于对事情的独特视角，还是善于讲故事？但要记住，学习和借鉴并非简单模仿，幽默最终需要融入你自己的个性和风格。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. 培养幽默的思维方式&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学会自嘲：&lt;/strong&gt; 这是幽默感的重要组成部分。敢于拿自己开玩笑，承认自己的不完美，会让你看起来更自信、更亲和。自嘲可以化解尴尬，也能让别人感到放松。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;换个角度看问题：&lt;/strong&gt; 尝试从不同的、甚至有些荒谬的角度去审视平常的事物。很多幽默都来源于对常规的打破和颠覆。当遇到不顺心的事情时，试着问问自己：“这件事有什么好笑的地方？”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;培养积极乐观的心态：&lt;/strong&gt; 幽默感往往与积极乐观的态度相辅相成。当我们以开放和轻松的心态面对生活时，更容易发现其中的乐趣。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. 练习和运用幽默&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;积累幽默素材：&lt;/strong&gt; 随身携带一个笔记本或使用手机备忘录，随时记录下你听到的、想到的好笑的段子、金句、故事或观察。建立一个属于你自己的“幽默资料库”。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;练习讲故事：&lt;/strong&gt; 幽默感不仅仅是讲笑话，更是一种讲故事的能力。学习如何铺垫、制造悬念、把握节奏和“包袱”，让你的故事引人入胜。可以先从亲近的朋友开始练习。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;把握时机和场合：&lt;/strong&gt; 幽默感需要“读懂空气”。了解听众的特点、场合的氛围，避免在不合时宜的时候开玩笑，或触及敏感话题。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;从小处着手，循序渐进：&lt;/strong&gt; 不要一开始就想着成为“笑话之王”。可以先从简单的幽默开始，比如在聊天中加入一些有趣的评论、适当的夸张，或者分享一些生活中的小趣事。慢慢地，你会越来越自如。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;与幽默的人多交流：&lt;/strong&gt; 幽默感是会相互感染的。多和那些有幽默感的朋友在一起，听他们如何说话，感受他们的幽默风格，你会潜移默化地受到影响。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. 其他建议&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;放松自己，享受过程：&lt;/strong&gt; 培养幽默感是一个自然而有趣的过程，不要给自己太大压力。重要的是享受这种发现乐趣和分享快乐的过程。当你放松时，幽默感更容易自然流露。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;多读书，扩大知识面：&lt;/strong&gt; 广博的知识储备能让你在谈话中更有深度，也更容易找到关联性，从而产生更高级、更有智慧的幽默。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;接受偶尔的“冷场”：&lt;/strong&gt; 并不是所有的幽默都会被所有人理解或欣赏。如果你的玩笑没有得到预期的反应，不要气馁，把它看作一次学习的机会，思考下次如何做得更好。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;幽默感是一个旅程，而不是一个目的地。通过持续的观察、学习和实践，你会逐渐发现并培养出属于你自己的独特幽默感。&lt;/p&gt;

A book on Social Psychology sparked my interests on
this field so I picked up a text book about it. The notion of &quot;Fundamental Attribution Error&quot; and its application on
World War II German society ignited my examination on my past 30 years of life as a Chinese.
</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social psychologists examine how the presence of others impacts how a person behaves and reacts and believe that &lt;em&gt;a
person&apos;s behavior is influenced by who else is present in a given situation and the composition of social groups&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important[Base Assumption of Social Psychology]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person&apos;s behavior is influenced by who else is present in a given situation and the composition of social groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavior is a product of both the situation (e.g., cultural influences, social roles, and the presence of bystanders)
and of the person (e.g., personality characteristics). Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one influence or
behavior over others. &lt;strong&gt;Situationism&lt;/strong&gt; is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate
environment and surroundings. In contrast, &lt;strong&gt;dispositionism&lt;/strong&gt; holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors
(personality traits and temperament of person). Modern approaches to social psychology, however, take both the situation
and the individual into account when studying human behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fundamental Attribution Error&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the U.S.&lt;/em&gt;, the predominant culture tends to favor a dispositional approach in explaining human behavior, because
people there tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors, and, therefore, any behavior change must
be due to something internal, such as their personality, habits, or temperament. This is called &lt;strong&gt;fundamental
attribution error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important[Prevailing Implicit Assumption of Western Social Psychology]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to assume that the behavior of another person is a trait of that person, and to underestimate the power of
the situation on the behavior of others. They tend to overemphasize internal factors as explanations - or attributions -
for the behavior of other people and tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational
variables, and thus to the person&apos;s state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Jamie returns home from work, and opens the front door to a happy greeting from spouse Morgan who inquires
how the day has been. Instead of returning the spouse&apos;s kind greeting, Jamie yells, &quot;Leave me alone!&quot; Why did Jamie
yell? How would someone committing the fundamental attribution error explain Jamie&apos;s behavior? The most common response
is that Jamie is a mean, angry, or unfriendly person (traits). This is an internal or dispositional explanation.
However, imagine that Jamie was just laid off from work due to company downsizing. Would the explanation for Jamie&apos;s
behavior change? The revised explanation might be that Jamie was frustrated and disappointed about being laid off and
was therefore in a bad mood (state). This is now an external or situational explanation for Jamie&apos;s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a culture in western countries, such as the U.S. and UK, that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy is
called &lt;strong&gt;individualistic culture&lt;/strong&gt;, which has the greatest tendency to commit the fundamental attribution error. In
contrast to the western countries&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;individualistic culture&lt;/strong&gt;, the east Asia countries, Latin American, and African
countries focus on the group more than on the individual, forming a &lt;strong&gt;collectivistic culture&lt;/strong&gt;, which takes into account
both situational and cultural influences on behaviors. The table below summarizes their differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Individualistic Culture&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Collectivistic Culture&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Achievement oriented&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Relationship oriented&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Focus on autonomy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Focus on group harmony&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dispositional perspective&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Situational perspective&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Independent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Interdependent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Analytic thinking style&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Holistic thinking style&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One consequence of westerners&apos; tendency to provide dispositional explanations for behavior is victim blame. When people
experience bad fortune, others tend to assume that they somehow are responsible for their own fate. A common ideology,
or worldview, in the United States is the just-world hypothesis. The &lt;strong&gt;just-world hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt; is the belief that people
get the outcomes they deserve. In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place, people tend to think that
good people experience positive outcomes, and bad people experience negative outcomes. &lt;em&gt;The ability to think of the
world as a fair place, where people get what they deserve, allows us to feel that the world is predictable and that we
have some control over our life outcomes&lt;/em&gt;. For example, if we want to experience positive outcomes, we just need to work
hard to get ahead in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution[Negative Consequence of the Just-World Hypothesis]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to blame poor individuals for their plight. Blaming poor people for their poverty ignores situational
factors that impact them, such as high unemployment rates, recession, poor educational opportunities, and the familial
cycle of poverty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extension of FA: Actor-Observer Bias &amp;amp; Self-Serving Bias&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to our earlier example, Jamie was laid off, but an observer would not know. So a naïve observer would tend to
attribute Jamie&apos;s hostile behavior to Jamie&apos;s disposition rather than to the true, situational cause. One reason is that
we often don&apos;t have all the information we need to make a situational explanation for another person&apos;s behavior. The
only information we might have is what is observable. Due to this lack of information we have a tendency to assume the
behavior is due to a dispositional, or internal, factor. When it comes to explaining our own behaviors, however, we
have much more information available to us. If we came home from school or work angry and yelled at our dog or a loved
one, what would our explanation be? We might say we were very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time - a
situational explanation. The &lt;strong&gt;actor-observer bias&lt;/strong&gt; is the phenomenon of attributing other people&apos;s behavior to
internal factors (fundamental attribution error) while attributing our own behavior to situational forces. As actors of
behavior, we have more information available to explain our own behavior. However as observers, we have less information
available; therefore, we tend to default to a dispositionist perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following an outcome, self-serving biases are those attributions that enable us to see ourselves in a favorable light
(for example, making internal attributions for success and external attributions for failures). When we do
well at a task, for example acing an exam, it is in our best interest to make a dispositional attribution for our
behavior (&quot;I&apos;m smart&quot;) instead of a situational one (&quot;The exam was easy&quot;). &lt;strong&gt;Self-serving bias&lt;/strong&gt; is the tendency to
explain our successes as due to dispositional (internal) characteristics, but to explain our failures as due to
situational (external) factors. Again, this is culture dependent. &lt;strong&gt;This bias serves to protect self-esteem&lt;/strong&gt;. We can
imagine that if people always made situational attributions for their behavior, they would never be able to take
credit and feel good about their accomplishments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Case Study - World War II Germany&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, Germany exhibited characteristics of a collectivist culture, particularly under the Nazi regime.
While Germany is generally considered an individualistic culture today, the Nazi regime emphasized collective identity,
national unity, and obedience to the state, prioritizing the needs of the nation above individual desires. This was
achieved through propaganda, strict social control, and suppression of dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Nazi Ideology and Collectivism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazi regime promoted a strong sense of national identity and collective purpose, emphasizing the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;
(people&apos;s community). This involved subordinating individual interests to the goals of the state, particularly in areas
like military service, economic production, and racial purity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Propaganda and Social Control&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazi regime used extensive propaganda to shape public opinion, glorify the nation, and demonize its enemies. This
propaganda often appealed to a sense of collective identity and purpose, fostering a sense of unity and shared destiny.
Strict social controls were also implemented to ensure conformity and suppress dissent, further reinforcing the
collective mindset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Suppression of Individualism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazi regime actively discouraged individualism and independent thought, particularly among those deemed
&quot;undesirable&quot;. Dissent was met with harsh punishment, including imprisonment and execution. This suppression of
individual expression and critical thinking contributed to a culture of conformity and obedience to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have &lt;a href=&quot;#fundamental-attribution-error&quot;&gt;discussed earlier&lt;/a&gt;, both dispositional and situational factors affect one
another&apos;s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In this section, we set the dispositional factors aside and examine
situational forces that have a strong influence on human behavior. These include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#social-roles&quot;&gt;social roles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#social-norms&quot;&gt;social norms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#scripts&quot;&gt;scripts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Roles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Social Role]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;social role&lt;/strong&gt; is a pattern of behavior that is expected of a person in a given setting or group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Norms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Social Norm]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;social norm&lt;/strong&gt; is a group&apos;s expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members - how they are
supposed to behave and think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each one of us has several social roles. One may be, at the same time, a student, a parent, an aspiring teacher, a son
or daughter, a spouse, and a lifeguard. These social roles influence our behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scripts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading Notes of &quot;INFLUENCE The Psychology of Persuasion&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever-accelerating pace and informational crush of modern life have been utilized to produce a distinct kind of
automatic, mindless compliance from people, that is, a willingness to say &quot;yes&quot; without thinking first. This particular
form of unthinking compliance will become more prevalent in the future. It will be increasingly important, therefore,
for the society to understand the how and why of automatic influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ia800203.us.archive.org/33/items/ThePsychologyOfPersuasion/The%20Psychology%20of%20Persuasion.pdf&quot;&gt;This book&lt;/a&gt;
is about the Psychology of compliance and helps us, as victims, identify the techniques of compliance professionals who
have been using the principles on us in a daily basis. The author of the book combines the school principles with 3-year
outside-of-school real experiences with compliance professionals, such as sales representatives, to produce the 6
fundamental psychological principles that direct human behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:::important[Rule for Reciprocation]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human societies derive a truly significant competitive advantage from the reciprocity rule, and consequently the
political authorities make sure their members are trained to comply with and believe in it. As a result, there is
general distaste for those who take but make no effort to give in return, and we will avoid being considered as such
persons. &lt;strong&gt;It is those attempts of such avoidance that individuals find opportunities to take advantage of on us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we all agree that people are more willing to do a favor for someone they like, under the rule of reciprocation,
even the relationship between liking and compliance was completely wiped out, demonstrating the overpowering
effectiveness of the rule. For those who owed somebody a favor, it made no difference whether they like that person or
not; they felt a sense of obligation to repay him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People we might ordinarily dislike, such as an unwelcome sales operator, disagreeable acquaintances, or even an
unpopular organization, can greatly increase the chance that we will do what they wish merely by providing us
with a small favor prior to their requests. Such small favor could be the &quot;free sample&quot; in marketing fields, a free
book, or even a flower, or even the acceptance of a refusal followed by a smaller compliance request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One feature of the reciprocity is that a small initial favor can trigger a substantially larger return favor. This is
often exploited by manipulators. The reason for us to accept such unfair exchange is that most of us find it highly
disagreeable to be in a state of obligation. It weighs heavily on us and demands to be removed. For this reason alone,
we may be willing to agree to perform a larger favor than we received, merely to relieve ourselves of the psychological
burden of debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commitment and Consistency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the human tendency for continuous commitment, People&apos;s desire for consistency has been a central motivation
of our behaviors, because a high degree of consistency is normally associated with personal and intellectual strength
while inconsistency is commonly thought to be an undesirable personality trait. It is at the heart of logic,
rationality, stability, and honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this highly-valued good personal consistency can be disastrous when it occurs unthinkinly. First, it
offers a shortcut through the density of modern life. Once we have made up our minds about an issue, stubborn
consistency allows us a very appealing luxury: We really don&apos;t have to think hard about the issue anymore. We need only
believe or do whatever is consistent with our earlier decision. We do so the allure of such a luxury allows us a
convenient, relatively, effortless, and efficient method for dealing with complex daily environments that make severe
demands on our mental energies and capacities. Second, when we are desperately longing for a solution and spot a one
that we think should solve the problem, the tendency of becoming consistent pushes us to our comfort zone by ignoring
any other rational opposing view. In this case, automatic consistency shields us against any painful yet meaningful
thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such consistency can also be exploited by those who would prefer that we not think too much in response to their
requests for our compliance. The author mentions the example of toy companies&apos; strategy to boost post-Christmas sales.
Normally, people over-spend during Christmas season which resulted in low sales during post-Christmas period. The toy
companies did the trick with pre-Christmas TV advertisement that shows attractive Christmas toys for children. The
parents would normally promis the advertised toy as Christmas gift for them. But later they &lt;em&gt;undersupply&lt;/em&gt; the stores
with these toys and substitute them with other toys of equal values and re-advertise those toys that have gotten the
parents to promise. In the end, the toy companies make double-money with the substitutes and the original toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Principle of Social Proof&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American public hates canned laughter in television shows. Why, then, is canned laughter so popular with television
executives? Experiments have found that the use of canned merriment causes an audience to laugh longer and more often
when humorous material is presented and to rate the material as funnier. In addition, some evidence indicates that
canned laughter is more effective for poor jokes. Why would we laugh more given the mechanically fabricated merriment?
The book answers this question by introducing &lt;strong&gt;The Principle of Social Proof&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;PSP&lt;/strong&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[The Principle of Social Proof]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of PSP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how fast we drive on highway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to eat the chicken at a dinner party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the actions of those around us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSP explains why, on commercial product websites, we see they list companies that are using the products - we see
using their products as more appropriate when others are doing the same thing. In the case of canned laughter, we use
other&apos;s laugh to help decide what is humorous and when mirth is appropriate. The fact that we laugh based simply on a
patently fraudulent laughter shows that people can exploit our preference for shortcuts, our tendency to react
automatically on the basis of partial evidence. One example is the aforementioned &quot;cheep-cheep&quot; of baby turkey. The
mother turkey gets fooled by the sound because it makes judgements based only on the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More examples of PSP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bartenders often &quot;salt&quot; their tip jars with a few dollar bills at the beginning of the evening to simulate tips left
by prior customers and thereby to give the impression that tipping with folding money is proper barroom behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertisers list &quot;best-sellers&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charity uses incessant listing of donors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salesmen are taught to spice their pitches with numerous accounts of individuals who have purchased the product
(&quot;Since 95% of the people are imitators and only 5% initiators, people are persuaded more by the action of others tha
by any proof we can offer&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Application of PSP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Elimination of Undesirable Behavior&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing a video (or a film examples) of a boy playing nicely with a dog helps children to remove fear of dogs. This is
an example of changing people&apos;s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;We Intend to Follow Others Under Uncertainty&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book P98 - Cause of a woman&apos;s death is due to uncertainty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story: A woman was murdered on a city street. 30 bystanders who observed the process never called police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis: Bypassing the sayings of those observers (e.g. &quot;I don&apos;t know; I don&apos;t want to get involved&quot;) as well as the peripheral observations about people being unfeeling in a &quot;Cold Society&quot;, the core issue lies in PSP: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In times of such uncertainty, the natural tendency is to look around at the actions of others for clues. We can learn, from the way the other witnesses are reacting, whether the event is or is not an emergency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Bystanders are &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;unsure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rather than unkind. When they are unsure, they follow others who are also unsure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to reduce the uncertainty of others: Be certain on what you need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. You, in blue jacket, I need help. Call an ambulance) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This brings back the original purpose of this book: How to produce compliance with a request - No general request to group of people; pick out one person and assign the task to that person instead; otherwise it is easy for everyone to assume that someone else should help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This explains why commercial product website has a chat window - they want to pick up you as that specific person in blue jacket!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Inclined to Follow Similarity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are more inclined to follow the lead of a similar individual than a dissimilar one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example is the advertiser who knows that one successful way to sell a product to ordinary viewers (who compose the largest potential market) is to demonstrate that other &quot;ordinary&quot; people like and use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Guard Against the Information That Social Proof Provides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSP gives us shortcut to make right decisions but not always. The key is to identify the wrong data in the crowd. Purposely falsified social evidence is an example of wrong data. e.g. canned laughter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A social rule - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we most prefer to say yes to the request of someone we know and like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;It&apos;s gotten to the point now where i hate to be invited to Tupperware parties. I&apos;ve got all the containers I need; and if I wanted any more, I could buy another brand cheaper in the store. But when a friend calls up, I feel like I have to go. And when I get there, I feel like I have to buy something. What can I do? It&apos;s for one of my friends&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;charity (P127)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endless-chain sales strategy (P128)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Physical Attractiveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halo Effects - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A halo effect occurs when one positive characteristic of a person dominates the way that person is viewd by others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical attractiveness triggers halo effect. We automatically assign to good-looking individuals such as favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence (we make these judgements without being aware that physical attractiveness plays a role in the process)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsettling research indicates that our judicial process is similarly susceptible to the influences of body dimensions and bone structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. e.g. handsome man received lighter sentences in criminal trials&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attractive people are more likely to obtain help when in need and are more persuasive in changing the opinions of an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Similarity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to physical appearance, we like people who are similar (opinion, personality, background, life-style) to us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interests - a strong example: Car salesmen, for example, are trained to look for evidence of such things while examining the customer&apos;s trade-in. If there is camping gear in the trunk, the salesman might mention, later on, how he loves to get away from the city whenever he can; if there are golf balls on the back seat, he might remark that he hopes the rain will hold off until he can play the eighteen holes he has schedules for later in the day; if he notices that the car was purchased out of state, he might ask where the customer is from and report - with surprise - that he (or his wife) was born there, too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Compliments - We are Phenomenal Suckers for Flatter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The information that someone fancies us can be a bewitchingly effective device for producing return liking and willing compliance. So, often in terms of flattery or simple claims of affinity, we hear positive estimation from people who want something from us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflects a lot of phenomenons in our society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why you see those celebrities give holiday greetings on TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why you see sales people regularly sends you &quot;happy new year&quot; or &quot;I like you&quot; card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Familiarity - Contact &amp;amp; Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, we like things that are familiar to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why familiarity plays a role in liking? &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our attitude toward something is influenced by the number of times we have been exposed to it in the past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this does not apply in all cases (Schooling exception). Hence the concept of &quot;cooperation&quot; is introduced. The concept is illustrated in the following experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children are splited into 2 competing groups -&amp;gt; Groups starts to fight against each other triggered by the grouping itself -&amp;gt; cooperation. e.g. combined forces to fix water problem, pull food truck, and renting a movie -&amp;gt; the common goals ended the battles between groups -&amp;gt; they become friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This experiment is very similar to video games in which people form 2 competing groups to fight against each other. The psychological effect is that people will separate each other more and more, which is not a great act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;The crucial procedure was the experimenters&apos; imposition of common goals on the groups&quot; - Managing a group of people in organization should focus on the innate personal goals of each individual employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to know when cooperation is appropriate because sometimes competition has its place, too. It can serve as a valuable motivator of desirable action and an important builder of self-concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done with children experiment, the book states that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although the familiarity produced by contact usually leads to greater liking, the opposite occurs if the contact carries distasteful experience with it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the evidence that team-oriented learning is an antidote to this disorder may tell us about the heavy impact of cooperation on the liking process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does all above apply to the persuasion of product buying? &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance professionals are forever attempting to establish that we and they are working for the same goals, that we must &quot;pull together&quot; for mutual benefit, that they are, in essence, our teammates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While choosing from potential employee candidates, organizations must carefully consider the goal alignment between corporate and the individual, so as to let employee do more good tings to their groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this is one of the reason for &quot;Mission Statements&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IMPORTANT - example of Good/Bad Cop P150&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conditioning and Association&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a natural human tendency to dislike a person who brings us unpleasant information, even when that person did not cause the bad news. The simple association with it is enough to stimulate our dislike. Vice Versa - establish connection between product and goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good-looking models standing around car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linking of celebrities to products in advertisement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congressional representatives traditionally announce to the press the start of federal projects that will bring new jobs or benefits to their home states; this is true even when a representative has had nothing to do with advancing the project or has, in some cases, voted against it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luncheon technique - We become fonder of the people and things we experience while we were eating (food is a source of positiveness)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pavlov: If the presentation of food to a god was always accompanied by the sound of a bell, soon the dog would salivate to the bell alone, even when there was no food to be had&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luncheon technique is an application of Pavlov&apos;s experiment: there are many normal responses to food besides salivation, one of the being a good and favorable feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrate on the liking effect rather than preventing it and notice the over-behavior of liking (e.g. the feeling that we have come to like the practitioner more quickly or more deeply than we would have expected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scarcity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scarcity Principle (SP) - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of potential loss plays a large role in human decision making. People seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value (e.g. homeowners told how much money they could lose from inadequate insulation are more likey to insulate their homes than those told how much money they could save).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reason that SP works is because as opportunities become less available, we lose freedoms; and we hate to lose the freedoms we already have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamental of Psychological Reactance Theory - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whenever free choice is limited or threatened, the need to retain our freedoms makes us desire them (as well as the goods and services associated with them) significantly more than previously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Application of SP - &quot;Limited-Number Tactic&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer is informed that a certain product is in short supply that cannot be guaranteed to last long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LN tactic assumes that the things that are difficult to possess are typically better than those that are easy to possess - availability decides on quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Application of SP - Fight for Freedom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cigarette ads via woman rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visitor purchases gun in gun-free city - people want what has been banned and therefore to presume that it is more worthwhile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extending SP - NEW Scarcity is More Powerful (Cookie Experiment)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do we want the same item more when it is scare, we want it most when we are in competition for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;hurry-to-buy&quot; on e-commerce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salespeople fake rich buyer/competitor to indecisive customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Do We Say No to Scarcity?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the cookie experiment, the joy is not in experiencing a scarce commodity but in possessing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we confront the scarcity pressures surrounding some item, we must also confront the question of what it is we want from the item. If the answer if that we want the thing for the social, economic, or psychological benefits of possessing something rare, then, fine; scarcity pressures will give us a good indication of how much we would want to pay for it - the less available it it, the more valuable to us it will be. But very often we don&apos;t want a thing purely for the sake of owning it. We want it, instead, for its utility value; we want to eat it or drink it or touch it or hear it or drive it or otherwise use it. In such cases it is vital to remember that scarce things do not taste or feel or sound or ride or work any better because of their limited availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metan Tape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubling the price of a never-sold jewelry triggered the sold-out of it -&amp;gt; there is a pattern &quot;expensive = good quality&quot; -&amp;gt; There is a specific feature of some identity that triggered human actions (purchase expense jewelry)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern is triggered a tap of actions from us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have our preprogrammed tapes; and, although they usually work on our advantage, the trigger features that activate them can be used to dupe us into playing them at the wrong times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example of Mental Tape - Ask for Favor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason. People simply like to have reasons for what they do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &quot;&lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; is a trigger of successful compliance request. e.g. cut in line to make copies (Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Example of Mental Tape - Expensive = Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g. jewelry example above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People learned from past experience that normally the price of an item increases along with its worth. Although it is not always correct, over all of the past and future situations of their lives, betting those shortcut odds may represent the most rational approach possible. &lt;strong&gt;Rich people are more likely to make rational decisions with less amount of time. The extra earned time can be used for other valuable investments, such as reading&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why we make such mental shortcuts? Because we don&apos;t have the time, energy, or capacity for it. Instead, we must very often use our stereotypes, our rules of thumb to classify things according to a few key features and then to respond mindlessly when one or another of these trigger features is present. &lt;strong&gt;In today&apos;s world, slow = failure. We have to act super quickly on all things to get there faster than others&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them&quot;. Take coupon as an example, we expect discount coupons to do double duty. Not only do we expect them to save us money, we also expect them to save us the time and mental energy required to think about how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most of us know very little about our automatic behavior patterns, they make us terribly vulnerable to anyone who does know how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contrast Principle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast Principle - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We may be less satisfied with the physical attractiveness of our own lovers because of the way the popular media bombard us with examples of unrealistically attractive models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of Contrast Principle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a man enters a cloth store to buy an expensive three-piece suit and cheap sweater, the sales person will always guide the man to buy the suit first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realty salesman shows undesirable houses first and then good houses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Ansible</title><link>https://ai.qubitpi.org/posts/configuration-management/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ai.qubitpi.org/posts/configuration-management/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;In Business World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chef generally utilizes a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/v6qowh/comment/ibiol0l/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;&gt;centralized&lt;/a&gt;
management approach while Ansible operates primarily in a decentralized manner&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chef (Centralized):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chef requires a Chef Server which acts as a central repository for configurations (cookbooks, recipes, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chef Clients installed on managed nodes communicate with the Chef Server to pull configurations and apply them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This structure ensures consistent configurations across the infrastructure, with the Chef Server acting as the
&lt;em&gt;single source of truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible (Decentralized):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ansible uses a control node to push configurations or tasks directly to managed nodes using standard protocols like
SSH or WinRM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not require installing agents on managed nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This decentralized approach allows for real-time updates and direct control over changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ansible can be used for centralized configurations by managing all configurations from a central control point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chef offers a &quot;Chef Solo&quot; mode which is a decentralized, serverless mode, but it lacks the centralized data store and
search capabilities of the Chef Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chef&apos;s centralized pull-based model provides &lt;strong&gt;more control&lt;/strong&gt; and visibility over our infrastructure, making it a very
good choice for &lt;strong&gt;2C&lt;/strong&gt; business. Ansible&apos;s push-based non-centralized model offers &lt;strong&gt;greater flexibility&lt;/strong&gt; and
scalability, making it well-suited for large-scale, distributed environments like &lt;strong&gt;2B&lt;/strong&gt; business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For Personal Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for personal provisioning, simplicity takes over everything. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bats.qubitpi.org/&quot;&gt;Bash and bats&lt;/a&gt; might
just be more than enough. CHEF or Ansible could just be a waste of time and hours. Never switch to an over-kill
technologies unless there is a real business need to do so (if our personal project someday becomes large and popular).
&quot;Would like to&quot; on some new and cool technologies doesn&apos;t necessarily justify the extra work spent shoveling sand.&lt;br /&gt;
Clarify our &quot;whys&quot; and the work will scope itself.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1e1653m/comment/lcs4dkl/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;&gt;^1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One day I stumbled upon a Reddit post where someone asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SpringBoot/comments/1fb6sn7/spring_ai_use_cases/&quot;&gt;whether Spring AI really outperforms Python-based webservices&lt;/a&gt;. An interesting answer caught my attention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::kokomi[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SpringBoot/comments/1fb6sn7/comment/lm5c8i1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;&gt;On Spring AI&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is just a new library giving you functionality that has long been available in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to whether to choose it or a Python microservice will be the same as choosing a language for any other
application. Does the product development team know Python or Java better? Which language will have greater advantages
in a particular application?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have to create an application that will be developed and maintained for many years by many people, I will not
choose Python, in my opinion Java (with SpringBoot) is much better for this. Additionally, in our company we have a
better CI/CD, observability, libraries and various tools for Java applications. In our case, Spring-AI (and similar
libraries) will finally allow us to create decent production-ready GenAI applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if I had to make a simple tool that I could run locally to provide some assistance using AI, I would probably
choose Python. Creating a Spring Boot application would take much longer and be more tedious to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in other companies it may look different&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to design a RAG pipeline on that day and I, like everyone else in a world of so many alternative choices
today, have couple of options that seem to have no dramatic differences for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://llamaindex.qubitpi.org/&quot;&gt;LlamaIndex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LangChain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haystack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TxtAI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is my pick? The Reddit post answer above pointed me to a sounding direction: &lt;em&gt;this is not a question of personal
preferences, but an objective consideration on &lt;strong&gt;practicality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I know the language for using that framework?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I need to learn before I can use the framework, do I have enough time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&apos;s the long term benefits of that choice, such as CI/CD and community support?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also applies to a software engineering team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team have a member portfolio that demonstrates high proficiency over the language of that framework?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team have enough time to deliver the business goal with that framework on board?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will ths software achieve good maintainability and extensibility in the long run?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me to think about software architect role beyond the scope of technology. Or in general, &lt;strong&gt;if I am leading a
tech team, what must be considered beyond technologies?&lt;/strong&gt; I searched and found this book to be a good starting point:
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/More-Essential-Skills-Software-Architects/dp/032190947X&quot;&gt;12 Essential Skills for Software Architects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rambhawan/Computer-Compiler-Lang/blob/master/12%20Essential%20Skills%20for%20Software%20Architects.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;)
by Dave Hendricksen whose chapter 11 directly addresses this concern. The chapter 11 was about how to bring
&lt;a href=&quot;#pragmatism&quot;&gt;pragmatism&lt;/a&gt; to the everyday world of software architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/12-skills-cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pragmatism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragmatism is the dose of reality that needs to be mixed into the daily decisions related to architecture. It is easy to
dream of architectural ivory towers, elegant designs, and a universe devoid of financial constraints. However, the job
of an architect is to hold vision in one hand and reality in the other hand, and to bring them together. The two
concepts have a natural resistance to each other—the same way two like-poled magnets repel each other. They can be
brought together, but only through force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Pragmatic Architecture, Definition]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pragmatic architecture&lt;/strong&gt; is the notion of driving toward an architectural vision (the strategic) while constraining
projects to reality (the tactical). That is, project dates, feasibility, financial costs, related project decisions,
and leverage capabilities or possibilities all need to be part of the mix in determining the &quot;best&quot; steps for the
architectural approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to pragmatic architecture is to manage through &lt;a href=&quot;#scope-management&quot;&gt;scope management&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;#risk-management&quot;&gt;risk management&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;#communication&quot;&gt;communication&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/triangle.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you have a new project proposal that absolutely, positively must ship on a specific date in four
months because of a trade show, and there is a limited budget to get it done. The project will deliver a key strategic
advantage for your company over your competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that three competing architectural approaches are available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first approach would require the use of some new open-source technologies that your company has no experience
with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second approach would require you to build the solution primarily from the ground up - a mostly
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project#Software_development&quot;&gt;greenfield development project&lt;/a&gt;, except that
it will need to be integrated with several of your legacy systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third approach would require you to hack a solution into the current legacy system, and would likely be fragile
under heavy use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have three days to come up with a final decision; complete cost estimates, resource needs estimates, risks estimates
(and their mitigation plans), and key assumptions; and review the proposal with all affected parties. On the fourth day,
you will present your plan to the executives, who will be looking to dive deep into any area they like and ensure that
the plan of attack is solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scope Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you may have your pet priorities for a project (those really cool new technologies or features that are just
looking for a project to fund their implementation), you need to consider the business needs to help determine what will
really help drive the ROI for this project and allow it to meet or exceed the financial expectations attached to the
project. If your pet technologies will truly help the business better meet its needs, then by all means consider them.
Here are some starting points to evaluate your pet technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with business team to determine feature priority&lt;/strong&gt;: figuring out how to properly sequence the feature
development of a particular project can be tricky business. Some infrastructure tasks will likely be needed to
implement the flashy new feature that provides the new sales capabilities that will nearly market itself. Taking time
to partner with the business can help prioritize the &quot;must have&quot; features and allow you to work through the real
dependencies so that the value can be delivered as quickly as possible to the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn to live with ambiguity&lt;/strong&gt;: As an architect, you will always have a need for more information to make a more
precise decision about the architecture for a particular project. No matter how many details you seek, there will
always be a level of ambiguity in the decision-making process. Develop a sense of when you have &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt;
information to make a reasonably calculated approach to allow a project to move forward with known assumptions and
risks. Over time, you will develop a sixth sense for areas you need to investigate more fully or to document as a
project assumption or risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On approach to deal with ambiguity is using Agile process, which will help you focus on the areas that need to be
addressed now, while allowing some ambiguous parts of the project to live in the backlog until they need to be
addressed as part of an iteration or as part of a spike (time-bounded proof of concept).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud-architecture.io/architecture/architectural-spiking/&quot;&gt;Architectural Spike&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architectural Spiking is running a small technical experiment, building working software to prove or disprove
feasibility or a specific hypothesis. Spikes are throw away code they are not integrated into released products,
they are used to prove or disprove a theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;time-bounded&lt;/em&gt; Architectural spikes can be applied when key decisions need to be made with respect to the
&lt;a href=&quot;#risk-management&quot;&gt;feasibility&lt;/a&gt; of a particular architectural approach in order to gain insight into the potential
route to take. To ensure a successful spike, follow these guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the key elements that require investigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid implementing a complete solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t ship it to production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document your results and recommendations because other groups will find this information helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For implementation, pick those people who are willing to dive into murky, uncharted waters and get tasks done with
minimal help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Risk Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing in new things is fun, but trying to get them operationalized is nearly always a challenge. One way to increase
the feasibility of a project is to minimize the number of new things you are injecting into the organization or to
sequence the changes such that you allow your project to incorporate the changes in a stable manner. When choosing among
broad set of possible technologies for an architectural approach, you need to take the following considerations into
account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which resources will implement the system? Do they need any training? Are they familiar with the architectural
approach being suggested?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has this architectural pattern been implemented previously in your company? In the industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which architectural spikes may be needed to remove any high-level risks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of licensig needs to be procured? Do you know what the costs for this licensing will be? Has anyone worked
with the company that is issuing the license? If not, it will be more difficult to bring the tool in. Are you willing
to go to bat for this tool if you are challenged by executives? (Choose your battles wisely.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there special hardware needs? Has your company used this hardware vendor before? Can you execute this project on
the cloud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you understand the nature of scaling the solution from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an application server perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a database perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a network perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a storage device perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a queuing perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a caching perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you need to scale up or scale out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have or can you build the appropriate tools that will enable your to monitor the system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you accounted for any reporting needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you understand how to build, deploy, and test the solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any legal or regularoty issues you need to address?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do patents or other intellectual property need to be secured or developed for the development work that will occur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this development effort need any special research and development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you understand when this project needs to be delivered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you able to structure the project across multiple organizations in a manner that minimizes coupling between the
groups and maximizes cohesion within the groups?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you understand the projected ROI for this project and the elements that will enable this ROI to be delivered?
(What promises are being made to the field when this product gets delivered? Can you deliver on those promises?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which alternatives have you considered? Why were some rejected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which future projects are in the pipeline that will build upon this project as stratigic infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this project align with the company&apos;s strategic long-term goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the project need to interact with any key software packages? Do any key software interfaces need to be
implemented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do any key data exchange formats need to be handled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you contemplate at least one reasonable design and implementation approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you understand key alternatives? (If some aspect of the project fundamentally fails, what are the alternatives - do
you have a good Plan B?) When during the project does a particular path need to be determined?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of addressing feasibility is to properly set expectations of all key stakeholders in terms of
assumptions, risks, financial costs, and alternatives. Help executives make the right decision by considering the
following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the operational implications of this decision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the hardware implications of this decision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the training implications of this decision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the maintenance cost implications of this decision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have any key architectural tenets been broken by this decision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the developmental cost of this decision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the decision enable the project to meet its delivery dates faster?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the quality of the project be affected materially?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are all key stakeholders commiteed to this change&amp;gt; If not, why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Type of Risks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New technology failing to deliver as planned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dependent project failing to deliver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial challenge that requires you to do with less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These likely risks and your ability to plan how to address them and which alternatives must be considered if and when
they happen will dramatically affect your ability to succeed on a regular basis. If you are able to deliver on your
promises even under dire circumstances, you will gain the reputation you need to be able to advance further up in the
organization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Software Operation Personnel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Involving those personnel who deal with the operational side of software development early on in the project development
life cycle can help minimize the operational costs once the project has gone into production, because operational costs
of a particular project can derail the project after being launched. Being the downstream group of the software, they
have insights into which types of information they need to access to deal with customers, such as customer complaints,
customer change requests, customer billing, and customer delivery alternatives. They may have insights into internal
processes as well. Learn how they are accustomed to processing information and identify the types of special access,
overrides, reprocessing, or other high-priority needs they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is Acceptable to Sacrifice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the point when the project gets real: when all of the lofty goals and aspirations turn toward getting the end
result out the door. When things go wrong for a project (and they will),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work with the business to determine which features are &quot;must-have&quot; and which strategic aspects of the project will
have to wait for another day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify whether automated parts of the process can be manually done (at least for a while)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Being Flexible as Architect&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certain amount of flexibility is needed during the implementation of a project. You need to clearly communicate in
which areas of the project there is some flexibility in terms of approach or features. Or sometimes the business may be
a bit tentative or unsure of what the right answer is or may not have done the necessary field studies to understand
certain customer nuances. If possible, try to understand the nature of where changes may be required, and build
flexibility into the designs to accommodate these changes if it is not overly expensive. Otherwise, seek to hold off on
implementing new features until customer feedback is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when software is being built, only a limited amount of variability and flexibility can be realized.
Indecisiveness that leads to significant rework will burn precious development dollars and needs to be kept to a
minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore take the time to document decisions along the way. Ensure that the decision log is properly distributed so
that there are no surprises. The key to success is proper expectations setting and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we deal with multiple alternatives among group of people also demonstrate how an architect can be flexible.
Whenever you need to present alternatives as part of making a decision, whether to executives, business partners, or
even your kids, your ability to clearly articulate which options are available and which option you would recommend will
produce a great starting point for a conversation. Don&apos;t be afraid to recommend the solution you want; you will often
get what you wish for. Be willing to defend your choice and show that you have really thought through the decision, but
be supportive of others who choose options that don&apos;t match your recommendation. If someone does choose an option that
you did not recommend, move forward and own the decision as if you made it. At the same time, &lt;em&gt;make sure the decision
maker understands the consequences of that decision (e.g., delays, cost)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Duality Nature of Architect - Technical and Managerial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I described in the blog cover, architect is not about reaching the top of technical skills, but a mental shift toward
a new skill sets while keep growing as what a technical person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Technical Ceiling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges that the very best technology folks (the gurus - the ones you go to when you have a difficult
problem that must be solved and solved right) often have is that they are often a complete pain to deal with. Their
approach and means of interacting are completely focused on correctness to the minutest detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;technical glass ceiling&quot; of those technology folks is simply missing soft skills. These skills can be learned,
although in most cases, the missing knowledge is usually filled in through a focused effort to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./img/tech-ceiling.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people filling more senior positions, detailed technical skills are useful, but the balance begins to shift toward
their ability to successfully interact with others, to get things done, and to sell their viewpoint. From technologists&apos;
point of view, the simple fact that the solution they are bringing forward is technically pure should be sufficient to
win its acceptance. They often believe that the solution should stand on its own without any sales required, and that
everyone should simply admire the beauty of the solution. Sometimes a technical person will fail to perceive that for
any project, a wide range of factors need to be taken into account. The product needs to deliver the best possible
return on investment (ROI) to those who are footing the bill. This often means squeezing in more functionality that may
not be &quot;perfect&quot;, but is, in fact, good enough at a cost that enables enough money to be made and in a time frame to
meet market needs. Often competing products are being developed, and the organization needs to be first to market to
gain the market leadership position that will enable it to charge a premium price for its product. Those factors on
humans interactions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Balancing relationships and correctness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a software development and engineering perspective, we are trained to look for defects (imperfections) and to
remove these flaws quickly (we have all kinds of ways to deal with this task: pair programming, unit tests, functional
tests, stress tests, code reviews, and so on). The challenge lies in the indisputable fact that people are not
software: We don&apos;t need to drive out their imperfections. Instead, we seek to maintain integrity and authenticity with
the other side, to provide valuable insights when appropriate, and to offer for other sot learn in a relatively quiet
manner. The best guide is to have other people&apos;s best interests at heart and to user our best judgment to figure out
how to proceed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics is that everyone loves to talk and have their ideas be added into the ecosystem. Once our resources, i.e.
programmers, are willing to contribute, they will begin taking ownership and will be willing to contribute even more
ideas. The first few ideas that people throw out are ONLY &quot;safe&quot; ideas. They are testing the waters to see if sharks
are present. If it proves to be safe, they are willing to begin bringing out their best and brightest ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning to delegate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key concept that enables this evolution to occur is allowing others to help determine the solution in order to
trigger their sense of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architects usually can only suggest ideas; they do not have direct management authority, unlike directors and
managers. This forces them to have to &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt; their architectural approaches. If the other side is a bad ass, the
advice below doesn&apos;t help, but in other case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t defend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be gracious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because if we respond with anything other than gracious acceptance, we are asking for non-gracious behavior in
response..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Realizing that life is reflexive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are receiving negative feedback about something we have done and care about passionately, we may act as if the
criticism is a personal attack rather than an evaluation of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t speak negatively about someone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for opportunities to build relationships&lt;/li&gt;

:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you explain when things don&apos;t go as we assume? Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve
things that seem to defy all of the assumptions? For example: Why is Apple so innovative? Year after year, after year,
after year, they&apos;re more innovative than all their competition. And yet, they&apos;re just a computer company. They&apos;re just
like everyone else. They have the same access to the same talent, the same agencies, the same consultants, the same
media. Then why is it that they seem to have something different? Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights
Movement? He wasn&apos;t the only man who suffered in a pre-civil rights America, and he certainly wasn&apos;t the only great
orator of the day. Why him? And why is it that the Wright Brothers were able to figure out controlled, powered man
flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified, better funded… and they didn&apos;t achieve powered
man flight, and the Wright Brothers beat them to it. There&apos;s something else at play here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About three and a half years ago, I made a discovery. And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the
world worked, and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it. As it turns out, there&apos;s a pattern. As it
turns out, all the great and inspiring leaders and organizations in the world, whether it&apos;s Apple or Martin Luther King
or the Wright Brothers, they all think, act and communicate the exact same way. And it&apos;s the complete opposite to
everyone else. All I did was codifying it, and it&apos;s probably the world&apos;s simplest idea. I call it the &lt;strong&gt;Golden Circle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? How? What? This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others
aren&apos;t. Let me define the terms really quickly. Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what
they do, 100 percent. Some know how they do it, whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your
proprietary process or your USP. But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do. And by &quot;why&quot;
I don&apos;t mean &quot;to make a profit.&quot; That&apos;s a result. It&apos;s always a result. By &quot;why,&quot; I mean: What&apos;s your purpose? What&apos;s
your cause? What&apos;s your belief? Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why
should anyone care? Well, as a result, the way we think, the way we act, the way we communicate is from the outside in.
It&apos;s obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. But the inspired leaders and the inspired
organizations -- regardless of their size, regardless of their industry -- all think, act, and communicate from the
inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you an example. I use Apple because they&apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it. If Apple were like
everyone else, a marketing message from them might sound like this: &quot;We make great computers. They&apos;re beautifully
designed, simple to use and user friendly. Wanna buy one?&quot; &quot;Meh.&quot; And that&apos;s how most of us communicate. That&apos;s how most
marketing is done; that&apos;s how most sales are done, and that&apos;s how we communicate interpersonally. We say what we do, we
say how we&apos;re different or how we&apos;re better; we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that.
Here&apos;s our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients, we always perform for our clients. Do
business with us. Here&apos;s our new car: It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats. Buy our car. But it&apos;s
uninspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s how Apple actually communicates. &quot;Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in
thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use
and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Wanna buy one?&quot; Totally different, right? You&apos;re ready to buy
a computer from me. All I did was I reversed the order of the information. What it proves to us is that people don&apos;t buy
what you do; people buy why you do it. People don&apos;t buy what you do; they buy why you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple. But we&apos;re also
perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple, or a DVR from Apple. But as I said before,
Apple&apos;s just a computer company. There is nothing that distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors.
Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products. In fact, they tried. A few years ago, Gateway
came out with flat-screen TVs. They&apos;re eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs. They&apos;ve been making flat-screen
monitors for years. Nobody bought one. Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs, and they make great quality products,
and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one. In fact, talking about it now, we can&apos;t
even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell. Why would you buy MP3 player from a computer company? But we do it every
day. People don&apos;t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what
you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s the best part: None of what I&apos;m telling you is my opinion. It&apos;s all grounded in the tenets of biology. Not
psychology, biology. If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, looking from the top down, what you see is the
human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle. Our newest
brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the &quot;what&quot; level. The neocortex is responsible for all of
our rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains, and our limbic
brains are responsible for all of our feelings, like trust and loyalty. It&apos;s also responsible for all human behavior,
all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, when we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated
information like features and benefits and facts and figures. It just doesn&apos;t drive behavior. When we communicate from
the inside out, we&apos;re talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to
rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from. You know sometimes you can
give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, &quot;I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn&apos;t
feel right.&quot; Why would we use that verb, it doesn&apos;t &quot;feel&quot; right? Because the part of the brain that controls
decision-making doesn&apos;t control language. And the best we can muster up is, &quot;I don&apos;t know. It just doesn&apos;t feel right.&quot;
Or sometimes you say you&apos;re leading with your heart, or you&apos;re leading with your soul. Well, I hate to break it to you,
those aren&apos;t other body parts controlling your behavior. It&apos;s all happening here in your limbic brain, the part of the
brain that controls decision-making and not language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you don&apos;t know why you do what you do, and people respond to why you do what you do, then how will you ever get
people to vote for you, or buy something from you, or, more importantly, be loyal and wanna be a part of what it is that
you do. Again, the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe
what you believe. The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it&apos;s to hire people who believe what you believe.
I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they&apos;ll work for your money, but if you
hire people who believe what you believe, they&apos;ll work for you with blood and sweat and tears. And nowhere else is there
a better example of this than with the Wright Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don&apos;t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley. And back in the early 20th century, the pursuit of powered man
flight was like the dot com of the day. Everybody was trying it. And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume, to be
the recipe for success. I mean, even now, you ask people, &quot;Why did your product or why did your company fail?&quot; and
people always give you the same permutation of the same three things: under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market
conditions. It&apos;s always the same three things, so let&apos;s explore that. Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars
by the War Department to figure out this flying machine. Money was no problem. He held a seat at Harvard and worked at
the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected; he knew all the big minds of the day. He hired the best minds money
could find and the market conditions were fantastic. The New York Times followed him around everywhere, and everyone was
rooting for Langley. And how come we&apos;ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe
for success. They had no money; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop. Not a single person
on the Wright Brothers&apos; team had a college education, not even Orville or Wilbur. And The New York Times followed them
around nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief. They believed that if they
could figure out this flying machine, it&apos;ll change the course of the world. Samuel Pierpont Langley was different. He
wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous. He was in pursuit of the result. He was in pursuit of the riches. And lo
and behold, look what happened. The people who believed in the Wright Brothers&apos; dream worked with them with blood and
sweat and tears. The others just worked for the paycheck. They tell stories of how every time the Wright Brothers went
out, they would have to take five sets of parts, because that&apos;s how many times they would crash before they came in for
supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903, the Wright Brothers took flight, and no one was there to even experience it. We
found out about it a few days later. And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing: the day the Wright
Brothers took flight, he quit. He could have said, &quot;That&apos;s an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improve upon your
technology,&quot; but he didn&apos;t. He wasn&apos;t first, he didn&apos;t get rich, he didn&apos;t get famous, so he quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don&apos;t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And If you talk about what you believe, you will attract those who
believe what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe? Something called the law of diffusion of
innovation, and if you don&apos;t know the law, you definitely know the terminology. The first 2.5% of our population are our
innovators. The next 13.5% of our population are our early adopters. The next 34% are your early majority, your late
majority and your laggards. The only reason these people buy touch-tone phones is because you can&apos;t buy rotary phones
anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Laughter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all sit at various places at various times on this scale, but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is
that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea, you cannot have it until you achieve this
tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration, and then the system tips. And I love asking businesses,
&quot;What&apos;s your conversion on new business?&quot; And they love to tell you, &quot;Oh, it&apos;s about 10 percent,&quot; proudly. Well, you can
trip over 10% of the customers. We all have about 10% who just &quot;get it.&quot; That&apos;s how we describe them, right? That&apos;s like
that gut feeling, &quot;Oh, they just get it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it before you&apos;re doing business with them versus the ones who don&apos;t
get it? So it&apos;s this here, this little gap that you have to close, as Jeffrey Moore calls it, &quot;Crossing the Chasm&quot; --
because, you see, the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first. And these guys, the
innovators and the early adopters, they&apos;re comfortable making those gut decisions. They&apos;re more comfortable making those
intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available. These
are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out, when you could&apos;ve just walked
into the store the next week and bought one off the shelf. These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat-screen
TVs when they first came out, even though the technology was substandard. And, by the way, they didn&apos;t do it because the
technology was so great; they did it for themselves. It&apos;s because they wanted to be first. People don&apos;t buy what you do;
they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe. In fact, people will do the things that prove
what they believe. The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours, stood in line for six hours, was
because of what they believed about the world, and how they wanted everybody to see them: they were first. People don&apos;t
buy what you do; they buy why you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me give you a famous example, a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation. First,
the famous failure. It&apos;s a commercial example. As we said before a second ago, the recipe for success is money and the
right people and the right market conditions, right? You should have success then. Look at TiVo. From the time TiVo came
out about eight or nine years ago to this current day, they are the single highest-quality product on the market, hands
down, there is no dispute. They were extremely well-funded. Market conditions were fantastic. I mean, we use TiVo as
verb. I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Laughter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But TiVo&apos;s a commercial failure. They&apos;ve never made money. And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40
dollars and then plummeted, and it&apos;s never traded above 10. In fact, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s even traded above six, except
for a couple of little spikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you see, when TiVo launched their product, they told us all what they had. They said, &quot;We have a product that
pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking.&quot; And the
cynical majority said, &quot;We don&apos;t believe you. We don&apos;t need it. We don&apos;t like it. You&apos;re scaring us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if they had said, &quot;If you&apos;re the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life,
boy, do we have a product for you. It pauses live TV, skips commercials, memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc.&quot;
People don&apos;t buy what you do; they buy why you do it, and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation. In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people
showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak. They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to
check the date. How do you do that? Well, Dr. King wasn&apos;t the only man in America who was a great orator. He wasn&apos;t the
only man in America who suffered in a pre-civil rights America. In fact, some of his ideas were bad. But he had a gift.
He didn&apos;t go around telling people what needed to change in America. He went around and told people what he believed. &quot;I
believe, I believe, I believe,&quot; he told people. And people who believed what he believed took his cause, and they made
it their own, and they told people. And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people.
And lo and behold, 250,000 people showed up on the right day on the right time to hear him speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of them showed up for him? Zero. They showed up for themselves. It&apos;s what they believed about America that got
them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August. It&apos;s what they
believed, and it wasn&apos;t about black versus white: 25% of the audience was white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world: those that are made by a higher authority and those
that are made by men. And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws that are made by the
higher authority will we live in a just world. It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing
to help him bring his cause to life. We followed, not for him, but for ourselves. And by the way, he gave the &quot;I have a
dream&quot; speech, not the &quot;I have a plan&quot; speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Laughter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans. They&apos;re not inspiring anybody. Because there are
leaders and there are those who lead. Leaders hold a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us.
Whether they&apos;re individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead, not because we have to, but because we want to.
We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves. And it&apos;s those who start with &quot;why&quot; that have the ability to
inspire those around them or find others who inspire them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading Notes - Start with WHY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Book]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;book-cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.earthgifts.com.au/ebook/simon-sinek-start-with-why.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
Simon Sinek, Portfolio, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phenomenons That Don&apos;t Start with Why (Part 1)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Assuming Too Much in the Beginning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all decisions work out to be the right ones, because our decisions are based on a perception of the world that may
not be completely accurate. The inaccurate information brings false assumptions. Although logic, more information and
data, and more advices from others could help, they still do not guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the book authors argues that there must be something outside of our rational realm that&apos;s missing from our
decision making process. He further gives an example where he compares American and Japanese automakers. A group of
American car executives went to Japan to see a Japanese assembly line. At the end of the line, the doors were put on the
hinges, the same as in America. But something was missing. In the United States, a line worker would take a rubber
mallet and tap the edges of the door to ensure that it fit perfectly. In Japan, that job didn&apos;t seem to exist. Confused,
the American auto executives asked at what point they made sure the door fit perfectly. Their Japanese guide looked at
them and smiled sheepishly. &quot;We make sure it fits when we design it.&quot; In the Japanese auto plant, they didn&apos;t examine
the problem and accumulate data to figure out the best solution—they engineered the outcome they wanted from the
beginning. If they didn&apos;t achieve their desired outcome, they understood it was because of a decision they made at the
start of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example is a metaphor of solving problems with short-term tactics/decisions v.s. actively assuming less from the
very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Manipulations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vicious circle of price game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incentives/Promotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear-based advertisement - &quot;Every thirty-six seconds, someone dies of a heart attack&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aspiration messages - &quot;Six easy steps to losing weight&quot; (⚠️ Aspirational messages are most effective with those who
lack discipline or have a nagging fear or insecurity that they don&apos;t have the ability to achieve their dreams on their
own. Someone who lives a healthy lifestyle and is in a habit of exercising does not respond to &quot;six easy steps to
losing weight.&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert/Celebrity-based endorsement in advertisement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Novelty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulations are short-termed and doesn&apos;t trigger loyalty. The reality is, in today&apos;s world, manipulations are the
norm. This book talks about an alternative - The &lt;strong&gt;golden circle&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./golden-circle.png&quot; alt=&quot;Error loading golden-circle.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start with WHY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike manipulations which manipulates in &lt;em&gt;HOW&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WHAT&lt;/em&gt; level, inspiration comes from the &lt;em&gt;WHY&lt;/em&gt; level. When we are
inspired, the decisions we make have more to do with who we are and less to do with the companies or the products we&apos;re
buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Golden Circle (Part 2) - It&apos;s What You Can&apos;t See That Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should focus on the &lt;em&gt;WHY&lt;/em&gt; behind customers&apos; needs, because it&apos;s not logic or facts but our hopes and dreams, our
hearts and our guts, that drive us to try new things. Products with a clear sense of WHY give people a way to tell the
outside world who they are and what they believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual can trust their gut decision by following that they love. It&apos;s not scalable thought, because the gut decision
can be a perfectly good strategy for an individual or a small organization, not for more people being able to make the
same decision that all feel right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s when the power of WHY come into play. The ability to put a WHY into words provides the emotional context for
decisions. When we know our WHY, we are able to put this subconsciousness into words. The rational of WHAT simply offers
the proof for the feeling of WHY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of business should not be to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have. It should be to focus on
the people who believe what you believe. When we are selective about doing business only with those who believe in our
WHY, trust emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Applications of Golden Circle (Part 3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Trust (Ch. 6)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We trust some people and companies even when things go wrong, and we don&apos;t trust others even though everything might
have gone exactly as it should have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust begins to emerge when we have a sense that another person or organization is driven by things other than their
own self-gain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to earn trust by communicating and demonstrating that you share the same values and beliefs. You have to talk
about your &lt;em&gt;WHY&lt;/em&gt; and prove it with &lt;em&gt;WHAT&lt;/em&gt; you do. Again, a &lt;em&gt;WHY&lt;/em&gt; is just a belief, _HOW_s are the actions we take to
realize that belief, and _WHAT_s are the results of those actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Constructing Team&apos;s Culture Builds up Trust&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultures are groups of people who come together around a common set of values and beliefs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we share values and beliefs with others, we form trust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, we do better in places that reflect our own values and beliefs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the goal is not to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have, but to do business with people who
believe what you believe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;live and work in a place where you will naturally thrive because your values and beliefs align with the values
and beliefs of that culture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s the culture - the strong sense of beliefs and values that everyone, from the CEO to the receptionist, all
share, that brings such group of people together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the goal is not to hire people who simply have a skill set you need, the goal is to hire people who believe what
you believe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of a leader is not to come up with all the great ideas. The role of a leader is to create an environment in
which great ideas can happen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Applications of Golden Circle to Organizaiton (Part 4)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Inspire with Charisma (The &quot;Why&quot;) (Ch. 8)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charisma comes from a clarity of &lt;em&gt;WHY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hume&apos;s introduction presents the idea of placing all science and philosophy on a novel foundation: namely, an empirical investigation into human psychology. He begins by acknowledging &quot;that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings [i.e., any complicated and difficult argumentation]&quot;, a prejudice formed in reaction to &quot;the present imperfect condition of the sciences&quot; (including the endless scholarly disputes and the inordinate influence of &quot;eloquence&quot; over reason). But since the truth &quot;must lie very deep and abstruse&quot; where &quot;the greatest geniuses&quot; have not found it, careful reasoning is still needed. All sciences, Hume continues, ultimately depend on &quot;the science of man&quot;: knowledge of &quot;the extent and force of human understanding,... the nature of the ideas we employ, and... the operations we perform in our reasonings&quot; is needed to make real intellectual progress. So Hume hopes &quot;to explain the principles of human nature&quot;, thereby &quot;propos[ing] a compleat system of the sciences, built on a foundation almost entirely new, and the only one upon which they can stand with any security&quot;. But an a priori psychology would be hopeless: the science of man must be pursued by the experimental methods of the natural sciences. This means we must rest content with well-confirmed empirical generalisations, forever ignorant of &quot;the ultimate original qualities of human nature&quot;. And in the absence of controlled experiments, we are left to &quot;glean up our experiments in this science from a cautious observation of human life, and take them as they appear in the common course of the world, by men&apos;s behaviour in company, in affairs, and in their pleasures&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Book 1: Of the Understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part 1: Of ideas, their origin, composition, connexion, abstraction, etc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hume begins by arguing that each simple idea is derived from a simple impression so that all our ideas are ultimately derived from experience: thus Hume accepts concept empiricism and rejects the purely intellectual and innate ideas found in rationalist philosophy. Hume&apos;s doctrine draws on two important distinctions: between impressions (the forceful perceptions found in experience, &quot;all our sensations, passions and emotions&quot;) and ideas (the faint perceptions found in &quot;thinking and reasoning&quot;), and between complex perceptions (which can be distinguished into simpler parts) and simple perceptions (which cannot). Our complex ideas, he acknowledges, may not directly correspond to anything in experience (e.g., we can form the complex idea of a heavenly city). But each simple idea (e.g., of the colour red) directly corresponds to a simple impression resembling it—and this regular correspondence suggests that the two are causally connected. Since the simple impressions come before the simple ideas, and since those without functioning senses (e.g., blindness) end up lacking the corresponding ideas, Hume concludes that simple ideas must be derived from simple impressions. Notoriously, Hume considers and dismisses the &apos;missing shade of blue&apos; counterexample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly examining impressions, Hume then distinguishes between impressions of sensation (found in sense experience) and impressions of reflection (found mainly in emotional experience), only to set aside any further discussion for Book 2&apos;s treatment of the passions. Returning to ideas, Hume finds two key differences between ideas of the memory and ideas of the imagination: the former are more forceful than the latter, and whereas the memory preserves the &quot;order and position&quot; of the original impressions, the imagination is free to separate and rearrange all simple ideas into new complex ideas. But despite this freedom, the imagination still tends to follow general psychological principles as it moves from one idea to another: this is the &quot;association of ideas&quot;. Here Hume finds three &quot;natural relations&quot; guiding the imagination: resemblance, contiguity, and causation. But the imagination remains free to compare ideas along any of seven &quot;philosophical relations&quot;: resemblance, identity, space/time, quantity/number, quality/degree, contrariety, and causation. Hume finishes this discussion of complex ideas with a sceptical account of our ideas of substances and modes: though both are nothing more than collections of simple ideas associated together by the imagination, the idea of a substance also involves attributing either a fabricated &quot;unknown something, in which [the particular qualities] are supposed to inhere&quot; or else some relations of contiguity or causation binding the qualities together and fitting them to receive new qualities should any be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hume finishes Part 1 by arguing (following Berkeley) that so-called &quot;abstract ideas&quot; are in fact only particular ideas used in a general way. First, he makes a three-point case against indeterminate ideas of quantity or quality, insisting on the impossibility of differentiating or distinguishing a line&apos;s length from the line itself, the ultimate derivation of all ideas from fully determinate impressions, and the impossibility of indeterminate objects in reality and hence in idea as well. Second, he gives a positive account of how abstract thought actually works: once we are accustomed to use the same term for a number of resembling items, hearing this general term will call up some particular idea and activate the associated custom, which disposes the imagination to call up any resembling particular ideas as needed. Thus the general term &quot;triangle&quot; both calls up an idea of some particular triangle and activates the custom disposing the imagination to call up any other ideas of particular triangles. Finally, Hume uses this account to explain so-called &quot;distinctions of reason&quot; (e.g., distinguishing the motion of a body from the body itself). Though such distinctions are strictly impossible, Hume argues, we achieve the same effect by noting the various points of resemblance between different objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part 2: Of the ideas of space and time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hume&apos;s &quot;system concerning space and time&quot; features two main doctrines: the finitist doctrine that space and time are not infinitely divisible, and the relationist doctrine that space and time cannot be conceived apart from objects. Hume begins by arguing that, since &quot;the capacity of the mind is limited&quot;, our imagination and senses must eventually reach a minimum: ideas and impressions so minute as to be indivisible. And since nothing can be more minute, our indivisible ideas are &quot;adequate representations of the most minute parts of [spatial] extension&quot;. Upon consideration of these &quot;clear ideas&quot;, Hume presents a few arguments to demonstrate that space and time are not infinitely divisible, but are instead composed of indivisible points. On his account, the idea of space is abstracted from our sense experience (arrangements of coloured or tangible points), and the idea of time from the changing succession of our own perceptions. And this means that space and time cannot be conceived on their own, apart from objects arranged in space or changing across time. Thus we have no idea of absolute space and time, so that vacuums and time without change are ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hume then defends his two doctrines against objections. In defending his finitism against mathematical objections, he argues that the definitions of geometry support his account. He then argues that since important geometric ideas (equality, straightness, flatness) do not have any precise and workable standard beyond common observation, corrective measurements, and the &quot;imaginary&quot; standards we are naturally prone to fabricate, it follows that the extremely subtle geometric demonstrations of infinite divisibility cannot be trusted. Next, Hume defends his relationist doctrine, critically examining the alleged idea of a vacuum. No such idea can be derived from our experience of darkness or motion (alone or accompanied by visible or tangible objects), but it is indeed this experience that explains why we mistakenly think we have the idea: according to Hume, we confuse the idea of two distant objects separated by other visible or tangible objects with the very similar idea of two objects separated by an invisible and intangible distance. With this diagnosis in hand, he replies to three objections from the vacuist camp—adding on a sceptical note that his &quot;intention never was to penetrate into the nature of bodies, or explain the secret causes of their operations&quot;, but only &quot;to explain the nature and causes of our perceptions, or impressions and ideas&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final section, Hume accounts for our ideas of existence and of external existence. First, he argues that there is no distinct impression from which to derive the idea of existence. Instead, this idea is nothing more than the idea of any object, so that thinking of something and thinking of it as existent is the very same thing. Next, he argues that we cannot conceive of anything beyond our own perceptions; thus our conception of the existence of external objects is at most a &quot;relative idea&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;What is OAuth 2.0?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAuth 2.0 is a &lt;em&gt;delegation&lt;/em&gt; protocol, a means of letting someone who controls a resource allow a software application to
access that resource on their behalf without impersonating them. The application requests authorization from the owner
of the resource and receives tokens that it can use to access the resource. This all happens without the application
needing to impersonate the person who controls the resource, since the token explicitly represents a delegated right of
access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, you can think of the OAuth token as a &quot;valet key&quot; for the web. Not all cars have a valet key, but for
those that do, the valet key provides additional security beyond simply handing over the regular key. The valet key of
a car allows the owner of the car to give limited access to someone, the valet, without handing over full control in the
form of the owner&apos;s key. Simple valet keys limit the valet to accessing the ignition and doors but not the trunk or
glove box. More complex valet keys can limit the upper speed of the car and even shut the car off if it travels more
than a set distance from its starting point, sending an alert to the owner. &lt;em&gt;In much the same way, OAuth tokens can
limit the client&apos;s access to only the actions that the resource owner has delegated&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749&quot;&gt;specification that defines it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note[What does OAuth 2.0 do as a security protocol?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service,
either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP
service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 components involved here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resource owner&lt;/strong&gt;: a person assumed to have access to a web browser and an API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;protected resource&lt;/strong&gt;: the component that resource owner has access to, i.e. the API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;client&lt;/strong&gt;: the software that accesses the protected resource &lt;em&gt;on behalf&lt;/em&gt; of the resource owner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &quot;client&quot; might confuse us to think this as the web browser or the person who&apos;s paying for our services, but
that&apos;s not how the term is used here. In OAuth, the client is whatever &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt; consumes the API that makes up the
protected resource. There are many different forms of client applications, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way OAuth 2.0 is different from the traditional username-password sharing mechanism is by introducing the 4th
component, the &lt;strong&gt;authorization server&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;AS&lt;/strong&gt;), which is trusted by the protected resource to issue special-purpose
security credentials called OAuth &lt;strong&gt;access tokens&lt;/strong&gt; to clients. To acquire a token, the client first sends the resource
owner to the authorization server in order to request that the resource owner authorize this client. The resource owner
authenticates to the authorization server and is generally presented with a choice of whether to authorize the client
making the request. The client is able to ask for a subset of functionality, or scopes, which the resource owner may be
able to further diminish. Once the authorization grant has been made, the client can then request an access token from
the authorization server. This access token can be used at the protected resource to access the API, as granted by the
resource owner (see figure below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./OAuth-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At no time in this process are the resource owner&apos;s credentials exposed to the client: the resource owner authenticates
to the authorization server separately from anything used to communicate with the client. The client is unable to access
anything on its own and instead must be authorized by a valid resource owner before it can access any protected
resources. This is true even though most OAuth clients have a means of authenticating themselves to the authorization
server. The user generally never has to see or deal with the access token directly. Instead of requiring the user to
generate tokens and paste them into clients, the OAuth protocol facilitates this process and makes it relatively simple
for the client to &lt;a href=&quot;#requesting-access-token&quot;&gt;request a token&lt;/a&gt; and the user to authorize the client. Clients can then
&lt;a href=&quot;#using-access-token&quot;&gt;manage the tokens&lt;/a&gt;, and users can manage the client applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A React Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we stumble upon an interesting web app that needs READ access to our Google Drive data, such as file and folder
names. Let&apos;s further assume that the web app requires users to login. After user logins, the web app will be able to
interact with Google Drive API on behalf of user to read their Drive data. The web app uses
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/overview&quot;&gt;Sign In With Google&lt;/a&gt; which handles the OAuth 2.0 flow
and application access tokens. To get user started with the web app, therefore, there must be a Login button&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start with the:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./login.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page above can be implemented with basic code below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;export const oauthConfig = {
    authEndpoint: &quot;https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth&quot;,
    tokenEndpoint: &quot;https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token&quot;,
    fileEndpoint: &quot;https://googleapis.com/drive/v3&quot;,
    clientId: &quot;your_client_id&quot;,
    clientSecret: &quot;your_client_secret&quot;,
    redirectUrl: &quot;http://localhost:3000/callback&quot;
};

function Login() {
    const handleLogin = (e: React.FormEvent): void =&amp;gt; {
        e.preventDefault();

        const authUrl = `${oauthConfig.authEndpoint}?client_id=${oauthConfig.clientId}&amp;amp;redirect_uri=${oauthConfig.redirectUrl}&amp;amp;scope=user_data&amp;amp;response_type=code`;
        window.location.href = authUrl;

        (e.currentTarget as HTMLFormElement).reset();
    };

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;button onClick={handleLogin}&amp;gt;Sign in with Google&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user initiates a login, they will be redirected to the authentication page hosted on Google authentication server
by &lt;code&gt;window.location.href = authUrl;&lt;/code&gt;. Then the user sees the familiar page like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./authorization.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;strong&gt;authorization&lt;/strong&gt; is granted by the user, the Google redirects user back to the app page specified by
&lt;code&gt;oauthConfig.redirectUrl&lt;/code&gt; which were provided in the snippet earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see why it&apos;s not &lt;em&gt;authentication&lt;/em&gt; because the user is simply authorizing the app to access the user&apos;s data on that
app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Requesting Access Token&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the redirected page (usually designated by a file called &lt;code&gt;Callback.tsx&lt;/code&gt;), the app does everything to fetch and saves
the access token to a state management such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://react-redux.qubitpi.org/&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { useEffect } from &apos;react&apos;;
import { useNavigate, useLocation } from &apos;react-router-dom&apos;;

function Callback() {
  const location = useLocation();
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
    const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
    const code = searchParams.get(&apos;code&apos;);

    if (code != null) {
      const payload = {
        client_id: oauthConfig.clientId,
        client_secret: oauthConfig.clientSecret,
        grant_type: &apos;authorization_code&apos;,
        code: code,
        redirect_uri: oauthConfig.redirectUrl
      };

      fetch(oauthConfig/tokenEndpoint, {
        method: &apos;POST&apos;,
        headers: {
          &apos;Content-Type&apos;: &apos;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&apos;
        },
        body: new URLSearchParams(payload)
      })
        .then(response =&amp;gt; response.json())
        .then(data =&amp;gt; {
          dispatch(setAccessToken(data.access_token as string));
            void navigate(&apos;/profile&apos;);
        })
        .catch(error =&amp;gt; {
          console.error(&apos;Error exchanging code for token:&apos;, error);
        });
    }
  }, [location, navigate]);

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      // some HTML markup for displayiing &quot;loading&quot; status, such as a spinner
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using Access Token&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that the user is taken to the business page, such as the user&apos;s profile page, in which the app fetches the access
token from state store and use that token to send API request to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function Profile() {
    const accessToken = useAppSelector(selectAccessToken);
  
    if (!accessToken) {
      return &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Please login first.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;;
    }
  
    return (
      &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Profile&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Access Token: {accessToken}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    );
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is wired by the app&apos;s home page of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from &apos;react-router-dom&apos;;

export default function App(): JSX.Element {
    return (
        &amp;lt;Router&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Routes&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&amp;lt;Proposal /&amp;gt;} /&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Route path=&quot;/callback&quot; element={&amp;lt;Callback /&amp;gt;} /&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Route path=&quot;/graph&quot; element={&amp;lt;Graph /&amp;gt;} /&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/Routes&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Router&amp;gt;
    );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons why timing is often the problem during software development are the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optimism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution[All programmers are optimists]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All will go well, that each task will take only as long as it &quot;ought&quot; to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumption, according to the author, is false, because given that creative activity contains 3 stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interaction (between creation and users)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation in software development is very tractable, making programmer over-optimistic about the implementation
difficulties, such as bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Not Taking Communication Efforts into Account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a partitioned work with no communications among distributed workers, such as wheat reaping and cotton picking, more
men power does mean faster overall work speed. In tasks that can be partitioned but which require communications among
workers of subtasks, however, the effort of communication must be added to the amount of work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such communication mandates 2 parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training: Each worker must be trained in the technology, the goals of the effort, the overall strategy, and the plan
of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercommunication: More workers means more intercommunication, i.e. depriving more task time of individual workers.
When the amount of intercommunication, brought by more divisions, increases past a threshold, it backfires and
lengthen the project time, instead of efficiently reducing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that, the man-day or man-month as a unit for measuring the size of a job is not appropriate, because it does not
take communication effort into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Under-Estimating the Time Needed for Writing Automated Tests and Debugging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#optimism&quot;&gt;Optimism&lt;/a&gt; falsely assumes there will be few bugs, resulting in much less scheduled time for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Scheduling Software Task]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\frac{1}{3}$ planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\frac{1}{6}$ coding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\frac{1}{4}$ writing automated tests with debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\frac{1}{4}$ &lt;a href=&quot;#optimism&quot;&gt;interaction&lt;/a&gt;, which entails potentially extra auto-tests and debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part, interaction, if not done properly leads to horrible product user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unjustified Estimation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers almost always ridiculize schedule completion for patron urgency. This is partially due to the lack of sounding
basis for estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 solutions for remedy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data-driven estimation: open productivity figures, bug-incidence figures, estimation rules, etc. Decision should be
driven by data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managers need to be able to defend their proposed estimate. It&apos;s about scientifically scheduling and professional
conduct&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding Manpower to a Late Software Project Makes it Later&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum number of men depends upon the number of &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; subtasks. From these 2 quantities one can derive
schedules using fewer men and more months. One simply cannot get workable schedules using more men and fewer months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But Too Few Man Is Too Slow for Really Big System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, in the last chapter, suggests that one wants the system to be built by as few minds as possible. Yet for
large systems one wants a way to bring considerable manpower to bear, so that the product can make a timely appearance
before the technology becomes obsolete. There is a trade-off here. How can these two needs be reconciled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mill&apos;s Proposal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::caution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the trade-off problem above is always there, the solution presented in this section, given it&apos;s discussed
in 1970&apos;s where the world of computing is considered &quot;ancient&quot;, has some limitations to the current date. This section
simply state the solution, for the record, followed by a discussion in the context of modern computing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each segment of a large job be tackled by a team, but that the team be organized like a surgical team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The surgeon: &lt;strong&gt;chief programmer&lt;/strong&gt; designs, writes, tests, and documents the code. Must be a great talent with 10 years
worth of experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The copilot: interface with other teams, knows all the code intimately, an &quot;extra hand&quot; to the surgeon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The administrator: interfaces with the administrative machinery of the rest of the organization, such as money,
people, space, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The editor: technical writer who enhances surgeon&apos;s documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 secretaries: 1 for administrator and 1 for editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The program clerk: maintains tech records and files of the team. All computer inputs goes to the clerk, who then logs
everything about the computing result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The toolsmith: ensuring the health of the various tools used by team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tester&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The language lawyer: gives advice on how to write program in a certain language elegantly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the roles, except for the surgeon, act as auxiliary personnel. We need to be little careful on this scheme of team
work. &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; came out the year of 1970&apos;s. What we need to understand is the difference in how software
was developed &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; v.s. &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. Back in the day pretty much all coding was done on paper first, was then keypunched
onto punched cards, then was read in, compiled, linked, executed, results were obtained, and the process repeated. CPU
time was an expensive and limited resource and we didn&apos;t want to waste it. Ditto and likewise disk space, tape drive
time, and etc. all took resources. Wasting perfectly good CPU time on a compile which resulted in errors was a waste of
perfectly good CPU time. And this was in 1975. At the time that Fred Brooks was developing his ideas, which was the
mid-to-late 1960&apos;s CPU time was even more expensive, memory/disk/whatever was even more limited. The idea behind The
&lt;a href=&quot;#mills-proposal&quot;&gt;Surgical Team&lt;/a&gt; was to ensure that the One Super Great Rockstar Developer did not have to waste their
time on mundane tasks like desk-checking code, keypunching, submitting jobs, waiting around (sometimes for hours) for
results. Rockstar Dude Developer Man was to &lt;em&gt;write code&lt;/em&gt;. Their legion of groupies/clerks/junior developers was supposed
to do the mundane stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conceptual Integrity in System Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the metaphor of European cathedrals, the hard work of several generation of builders, the authors argues that the
&lt;strong&gt;conceptual integrity&lt;/strong&gt; is a continuous improvements by generations of designers over a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How is Conceptual Integrity Achieved?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author stated that the conceptual integrity is possible by the following maneuvers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#function-vs-complexity&quot;&gt;Maximizing functions while minimizing complexities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#one-mind-vs-many-hands&quot;&gt;Conceptual integrity from one or fiew minds, while its implementation is by many hands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Function v.s. Complexity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are programming system, different from a computer system, whose purpose is to make computer easier to use. In
modern days, this can be Spring framework for example. The ease of use is enhanced only if the time gained in functions
exceeds the time lost in learning, remembering, and searching manuals. For instance, learning how to write a Spring Boot
application took about 10 minutes which in turn avoided 10 hours of starting-from-scratch. This makes the webservice
development &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantitatively, the ratio of functions gained to the conceptual complexity costed determines the system design
effectiveness. It should be noted that, therefore, neither function alone nor simplicity alone defines a good design. In
addition, &lt;em&gt;simplicity&lt;/em&gt; is not enough; it is the combination os &lt;em&gt;simplicity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;straightforwardness&lt;/em&gt;_ that reflects the
conceptual integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;One Mind v.s. Many Hands&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptual integrity requires that the design must proceed from &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; mind, or from a very small number of agreeing
resonant minds. Scheduling pressures, however, dictate that system building needs &lt;strong&gt;many&lt;/strong&gt; hands. These two conflicting
agendas can be reconciled by 2 strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labor division between architecture and implementation (discussed below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new way of structuring implementation teams (&lt;a href=&quot;#but-too-few-man-is-too-slow-for-really-big-system&quot;&gt;discussed above&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note[What is the architecture of a system?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete and detailed specification of the user interface. Such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;programming manual of a computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;language manual of a compiler or control program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system architect is the user&apos;s agent. Their straight stakeholder is user, not salesman. Where architecture tells
&lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; happens, implementation tells &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it is made to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptual integrity of a system determines its ease of use. Good features and ideas that do not integrate with a
system&apos;s basic concepts are best left out. If there appear many such important but incompatible ideas, one scraps the
whole system and starts again on an integrated system with different basic concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since conceptual integrity of a system determines its ease of use and conceptual integrity also comes from one or few
minds, the job of creatively designing an architecture must sit in the hands of the few, i.e. the architects, and there
will be many more implementors who, on the contrary, also creatively implementing that architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from the beginning that the total creative effort involves &lt;a href=&quot;#optimism&quot;&gt;three distinct phases&lt;/a&gt;: architecture,
implementation, and realization. The 3 phases can execute in parallel in many ways and together speed up the entire
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Humanistic psychology&lt;/em&gt; is a psychological perspective that arose in the mid-20th century in answer to two theories:
Sigmund Freud&apos;s psychoanalytic theory and B. F. Skinner&apos;s behaviorism. Abraham Maslow, in this context, established
the need for a &quot;third force&quot; in psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hierarchy of Needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source - &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Maslow#Hierarchy_of_needs&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow described human needs as ordered in a prepotent hierarchy - a pressing need would need to be mostly satisfied
before someone would give their attention to the next highest need. None of his published works included a visual
representation of the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./Maslow-Hierarchy-of-Needs.svg&quot; alt=&quot;An interpretation of Maslow&apos;s hierarchy of needs, represented as a pyramid, with the more basic needs at the bottom&quot; title=&quot;Error loading Maslow-Hierarchy-of-Needs.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pyramidal diagram illustrating the Maslow needs hierarchy may have been created by a psychology textbook publisher
as an illustrative device. This now iconic pyramid frequently depicts the spectrum of human needs, both physical and
psychological, as accompaniment to articles describing Maslow&apos;s needs theory and may give the impression that the
hierarchy of needs is a fixed and rigid sequence of progression. Yet, starting with the first publication of his theory
in 1943, Maslow described human needs as being relatively fluid—with many needs being present in a person simultaneously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Maslow&apos;s theory, when a human being ascends the levels of the hierarchy having fulfilled the needs in the
hierarchy, one may eventually achieve self-actualization. Late in life, Maslow came to conclude that self-actualization
was not an automatic outcome of satisfying the other human needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human needs as identified by Maslow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the bottom of the hierarchy are the &quot;basic needs or physiological needs&quot; of a human being: food, water, sleep, sex,
homeostasis, and excretion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next level is &quot;safety needs: security, order, and stability&quot;. These two steps are important to the physical
survival of the person. Once individuals have basic nutrition, shelter and safety, they attempt to accomplish more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third level of need is &quot;love and belonging&quot;, which are psychological needs; when individuals have taken care of
themselves physically, they are ready to share themselves with others, such as with family and friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fourth level is achieved when individuals feel comfortable with what they have accomplished. This is the &quot;esteem&quot;
level, the need to be competent and recognized, such as through status and level of success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then there is the &quot;cognitive&quot; level, where individuals intellectually stimulate themselves and explore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that is the &quot;aesthetic&quot; level, which is the need for harmony, order and beauty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the top of the pyramid, &quot;need for self-actualization&quot; occurs when individuals reach a state of harmony and
understanding because they are engaged in achieving their full potential. Once a person has reached the
self-actualization state they focus on themselves and try to build their own image. They may look at this in terms of
feelings such as self-confidence or by accomplishing a set goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first four levels are known as deficit needs or D-needs. This means that if there are not enough of one of those
four needs, there will be a need to get it. Getting them brings a feeling of contentment. These needs alone are not
motivating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow wrote that &lt;a href=&quot;#preconditions-for-satisfying-basic-needs&quot;&gt;there are certain conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the basic needs to be satisfied. For
example, freedom of speech, freedom to express oneself, and freedom to seek new information&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;A Theory of Human Motivation&lt;/em&gt;) are a few of the prerequisites. Any blockages of these freedoms could prevent the
satisfaction of the basic needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-actualization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow defined self-actualization as achieving the fullest use of one&apos;s talents and interests—the need &quot;to become
everything that one is capable of becoming&quot;. As implied by its name, self-actualization is highly individualistic and
reflects Maslow&apos;s premise that the self is &quot;sovereign and inviolable&quot; and entitled to &quot;his or her own tastes, opinions,
values, etc.&quot; Indeed, some have characterized self-actualization as &quot;healthy narcissism&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Qualities of Self-actualizing People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow realized that the self-actualizing individuals he studied had similar personality traits. All were &quot;reality
centered&quot;, able to differentiate what was fraudulent from what was genuine. They were also &quot;problem centered&quot;, meaning
that they treated life&apos;s difficulties as problems that demanded solutions. These individuals also were comfortable being
alone and had healthy personal relationships. They had only a few close friends and family rather than a large number of
shallow relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-actualizing people tend to focus on problems outside themselves; have a clear sense of what is true and what is
false; are spontaneous and creative; and are not bound too strictly by social conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maslow noticed that self-actualized individuals had a better insight of reality, deeply accepted themselves, others and
the world, and also had faced many problems and were known to be impulsive people. These self-actualized individuals
were very independent and private when it came to their environment and culture, especially their very own individual
development on &quot;potentialities and inner resources&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Maslow, self-actualizing people share the following qualities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truth: honest, reality, beauty, pure, clean and unadulterated completeness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness: rightness, desirability, uprightness, benevolence, honesty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beauty: rightness, form, aliveness, simplicity, richness, wholeness, perfection, completion,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wholeness: unity, integration, tendency to oneness, interconnectedness, simplicity, organization, structure, order,
not dissociated, synergy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dichotomy-transcendence: acceptance, resolution, integration, polarities, opposites, contradictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliveness: process, not-deadness, spontaneity, self-regulation, full-functioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniqueness: idiosyncrasy, individuality, non comparability, novelty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfection: nothing superfluous, nothing lacking, everything in its right place, just-rightness, suitability, justice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Necessity: inevitability: it must be just that way, not changed in any slightest way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completion: ending, justice, fulfillment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justice: fairness, suitability, disinterestedness, non partiality,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order: lawfulness, rightness, perfectly arranged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplicity: abstract, essential skeletal, bluntness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richness: differentiation, complexity, intricacy, totality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effortlessness: ease; lack of strain, striving, or difficulty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playfulness: fun, joy, amusement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-sufficiency: autonomy, independence, self-determining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maslow based his theory partially on his own assumptions about human potential and partially on his case studies of
historical figures whom he believed to be self-actualized, including Albert Einstein and Abraham Lincoln. Consequently,
Maslow argued, the way in which essential needs are fulfilled is just as important as the needs themselves. Together,
these define the human experience. To the extent a person finds cooperative social fulfillment, he establishes
meaningful relationships with other people and the larger world. In other words, he establishes meaningful connections
to an external reality - an essential component of self-actualization. In contrast, to the extent that vital needs find
selfish and competitive fulfillment, a person acquires hostile emotions and limited external relationships - his
awareness remains internal and limited&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Key Argument of the Book]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In order for individuals to thrive and excel, a health-fostering culture must be created.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 2 - Focusing on &lt;em&gt;Problems&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Key Point]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The essence of science lies in its problems, questions, functions, or goals rather than the instruments, techniques,
procedures, apparatus, and its methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(I think) This applies to everything from personal development to business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Means centering tends to push people to become the &quot;apparatus men, &quot;rather than the &quot;question askers&quot; and the problem
solvers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Means centering tends strongly to overvalue quantification indiscriminately and as an end in itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Means-centered people tends to fit problems to techniques rather than the contrary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Means-centered culture creates cleavage between teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If workers looked on themselves as question askers and problem solvers rather than specialized technicians, there would
be more autonomous and creative work outcome that targets more on the &lt;em&gt;problems&lt;/em&gt; rathern than the &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 3 - The 16 Propositions about Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual is an integrated, organized whole&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunger&lt;/em&gt; is not a paradigm for all other motivations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our desires are &lt;em&gt;means to an end&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;ends in themselves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This implies that the study of motivation must be in part the study of the ultimate human goals or desires or needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Means&lt;/em&gt; are usually conscious while &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; are often unconscious. They are related in complicated way and we must
study a person in whole to see their unconscious &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Human desire) &lt;em&gt;Ends in themselves&lt;/em&gt; are universal although the &lt;em&gt;means to these ends&lt;/em&gt; taken by different people can be
dramatically different&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conscious act or wish has more than one possible unconscious motivations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivation never ends, because is keeps triggering other motivations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human being is never satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We must thrive to explore a chain of motivations rather than a single one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not &quot;list of drives&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, there are unconscious fundamental goals/needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivation theory must be anthropocentric (human) rather than animalcentric (white rat)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environment shapes motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrated person can behave disintegrated under certain overwhelming situations so that main capacities of the
person are still left free for the more important or more challenging problems that it faces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all behaviors are motivation-driven, for example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-actualization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maturation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human are wish-realistic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality shapes the dynamics between Freudian Id and Ego&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on healthy person instead of psychotherapists&apos;s neurotic sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 4 - Basic Needs: Just the Basic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we are talking about here is also called &lt;em&gt;Gratification Theory&lt;/em&gt; - gratifying a lower need bumps a person to the
next level of need. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/NKEhdsnKKHs?t=411&quot;&gt;validity&lt;/a&gt; of this theory is justified given the following
premises being true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frustration Theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning Theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theory of Neurosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theory of Psychological Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theory of values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theory of discipline, will, responsibility, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, it must be kept in mind that there are determinants other than the Basic Need gratifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Basic Needs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[UNCONSCIOUS CHARACTER OF NEEDS]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following needs tend to be more unconscious than conscious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physiological Needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nutritions for survival&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indicated by specific appetites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those that are deprived of a person are regarded as being more important than something else higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indication: preference for undisrupted routine or rhythm. e.g. justice, consistency, ordered world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permissiveness within limits, rather than unrestricted permissiveness is preferred as well as needed by children.
Perhaps one could express this more accurately by saying that the child needs an organized and structured world
rather than an unorganized or unstructured one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with excessive expression of closeness with their parents might suggest they are seeing themselves facing a
world of much greater danger, because infant tend to cling to parents at times of feeling unsafe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify the degree of safety needs of a person requires us to look at that person from an economic and social
context&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologically, these behaviors also shows people&apos;s attempts to seek safety&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people&apos;s preference for familiar/known rather than unfamiliar/unknown things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tendency to have some religion or world philosophy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too freaking-out about some world events that seems to be a catastrophe to them; they seem to be looking for a
Fuehrer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurotic individual may be described with great usefulness as a grown-up person who retains his childhood
attitudes toward the world. That is to say, a neurotic adult may be said to behave as if he were actually afraid of
a spanking, or of his mother&apos;s disapproval, or of being abandoned by his parents, or having his food taken away from
him. It is as if his childish attitudes of fear and threat reaction to a dangerous world had gone underground, and
untouched by the growing up and learning processes, were now ready to be called out by any stimulus that would make
a child feel endangered and threatened. Horney[^1] especially has written well about &quot;basic anxiety&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sense of Belong and Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of activities within our societies are driven by the hunger for belongness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love is not sex. Love is about giving and receiving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esteem Needs&lt;/strong&gt; (strength &amp;amp; reputation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Actualization&lt;/strong&gt; (He or she must be true to their own nature)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The desire to become more and more what one idiosyncratically is, to become everything that one is capable of
becoming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual differences are greatest at this level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that such order of hierarchy is not rigidly fixed for everyone. The arrangement of basic needs
differs according to different people&apos;s priority or potency. For example, some seek self-esteem (&lt;em&gt;Esteem Needs&lt;/em&gt;) before
&lt;em&gt;Sense of Belong and Love&lt;/em&gt;; some simply lost the desire for love. In addition, everyone has all 5 needs partially filled
and unfilled while climbing up the pyramid and people tend to develop all 5 levels at the same time with different
speed. With that said then, most human behaviors are &lt;em&gt;multimotivated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The needs above are all driven motivations. Not all behaviors, however, are motivation-driven. Motivation-driven
behaviors are what we called &lt;em&gt;expressive behaviors&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, &lt;em&gt;coping behaviors&lt;/em&gt; is purposive goal seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;satisfied&lt;/em&gt; need does not motivate us anymore. If that&apos;s the case, the author postulates further that what really
motivates us is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;the need to develop and actualize our fullest potentialities and capacities&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 5 - Consequences of Basic Needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People learn in a certain way toward certain learning goal &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; for the gratification of the basic needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early-childhood gratifications tends to shape a healthier adult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different degrees of gratifications shapes personalities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with gratifications of higher levels tend to be more psychologically healthier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 6 - Something I Really Don&apos;t Care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 7 - Higher v.s. Lower Needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher need is a later phyletic or evolutionary development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher needs are later ontogenetic developments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher the need the less imperative at as for sheer survival, the longer gratification can be postponed, and the
easter it as for the need to disappear permanently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher needs are less urgent subjectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher need gratifications produce more desirable subjective results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pursuit and gratification of higher needs represent a general healthward trend,  a trend away from psychopathology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The higher need has more preconditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A greater value is usually placed upon the higher need than upon the lower by those who have been gratified in both&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pursuit and gratification of the higher needs leads to greater, stronger, and truer individualism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 8 - Theory of Threat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter talks about what a &lt;em&gt;threat&lt;/em&gt; really is for human. What are its relationships to various Psychological
phenomenons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person targets towards a goal (or &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt;) for two causes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its intrinsic meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its symbolic value (psychological values)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve all experienced deprivation and frustration. The distinction between the two is that deprivation on non-basic
needs does not lead to frustration. Only the deprivation of an object&apos;s symbolic value from a person could lead to
frustration. This has an important application in the dominance-subordinate relationship (e.g. working environment). The
dominance feels safe by keeping objects with symbolic dominance value on their side. Taking such away from them triggers
their hostile attacks. It is safe to gain support, permission, or resources from the dominance if subordinate can
deprive them of its symbolic value. Another example is when you know your friends truly love you, you respond gently
to their criticism instead of becoming angry. In this sense, &lt;strong&gt;a thread to personality comes from the deprivation of
symbolic value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author then argues that the nature of &lt;em&gt;threat&lt;/em&gt;, however, is not subsumed under the concept of frustration, but more
attributed to pathogenic psychopathology, such as illness, brain-injured, and trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 9 - Something I Really Don&apos;t Care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 10 - Expression v.s. Coping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is the preliminary to the important task of &lt;a href=&quot;#chapter-14---unmotivated-and-purposeless-reactions&quot;&gt;challenging and calling into question the generally accepted
belief that all behavior is motivated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expression (unlearned, non-instrumental) and coping (learned, instrumental, adaptive, functional, purposive) differs
mainly in terms of internal and external motivations. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coping is by definition purposive and motivated, expression is often unmotivated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coping is more determined by external environmental and cultural variables, expression is largely determined by the
state of the organism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, &lt;em&gt;coping behavior&lt;/em&gt; always has among its determinants drives, needs, goals, purposes, functions, or aims. It
comes into existence to get something done, eg, walking to some destination, shopping for food, going to mail a letter,
building a set of bookshelves, or doing the work for which we get paid. The term coping itself implies the attempt to
solve a problem or at least to deal with it. &lt;strong&gt;It therefore implies a reference to something beyond itself; it is NOT
self-contained&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Expressive behavior&lt;/em&gt;, however, is generally unmotivated, such as the style of writing and walking,
the beauty of beautiful woman, and delightful expression of a happy person. These are non-purposive. They have no aim or
goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, coping behavior tends to die out unless rewarded, expression often persists without reward or reinforcement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author extended the concept by introducing the &lt;em&gt;motivated self expression&lt;/em&gt;. For example, a sophisticated person can
&lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to be honest and kind; a motivated self-expressive dancer need to &lt;em&gt;learn to be spontaneous and natural&lt;/em&gt;. In the
human need for love, it starts as a coping which a person lacks and, once being gained, is later being developed
internally and differently in each individual, thus reflecting the expressive nature of a self-actualization. This
indicates that there is a dynamics between coping and expressive behavior: &lt;strong&gt;One can try to go in the direction of
self-actualization by solving the lesser, prerequisite motivational problems&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover image of my leadership blog is &lt;strong&gt;Ardeth Bay&lt;/strong&gt;, a Medjai chieftain and warrior in a movie I watched few years
back - &lt;a href=&quot;http://j.mp/1uwn500&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mummy Returns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the descendent of royal Egyptian secret bodyguards also knows as &lt;em&gt;the Medjai&lt;/em&gt;, Ardeth is the leader of 12 Medjai
tribes that together control tens of thousands of warriors. For over 3000 years, Ardeth along with his Medjai worriors
in desert performs the duty of safeguarding the eternal confinement which prevents the ancient evil supernatural powers
from releasing to this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What captures me most subconsciously about Ardeth was a movie scene where Ardeth laid sat on one of the half-broken bus
chairs for a break after a dangerous yet successful battle with Rick O&apos;Connell&apos;s family against 4 enemy mummies on a
double-deck British bus when Rick asked if he&apos;s alright, he smiled genuinely and replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::note[Ardeth]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;This was my first bus-ride&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. (see the clip below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZaOKSRIMmk?start=234&quot; title=&quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of &quot;fake&quot; leaders who enjoys the countless power and wealth and yet there is a true leader who at his
adult age never had the experience of boarding a regular bus. While those fake leaders always shot for short-term gains
for their personal wealth, Ardeth throughout the entire movie is focusing something bigger beyond himself - serving for
his people, his faith, and his value. Wealth, power, or all those luxury lifestyles are meaningless to him. What
distinguish Ardeth from other &quot;leaders&quot; is that Ardeth is truely an earch-touching leader with an
&lt;a href=&quot;#the-infinite-game1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;infinite-game mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no &quot;end&quot; for a leader. A leader is not someone who sits at the top enjoying champaign in a glorious golden
house, but instead like Ardeth who hold his position, his integrity, and his faith somewhere in a place where he
belongs, where he is fulfilling the oath of his ancestors&apos; duties, and where he someday shall pass this glorious
responsibility to his next generations and all the way to the &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Infinite Game[^1]&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./the-infinite-game.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large groups of people, united in common cause, chose to collaborate with no clear end in sight because we felt like we
were contributing to something bigger than ourselves, something with value that would last well beyond our own lifetimes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well within our power to build a world in which the vast majority of us wake up every single morning inspired,
feel safe at work and return home fulfilled at the end of the day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great leaders are the ones who think beyond &quot;short term&quot; versus &quot;long term.&quot; They are the ones who know that it is not
about the next quarter or the next election; it is about the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we lead with a finite mindset in an infinite game, it leads to all kinds of problems, the most common of which
include the decline of trust, cooperation and innovation. Leading with an infinite mindset in an infinite game, in
contrast, really does move us in a better direction. Groups that adopt an infinite mindset enjoy vastly higher levels of
trust, cooperation and innovation and all the subsequent benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Just Cause&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing competition, we keep being ourselves. Fighting to &quot;win&quot; v.s. Fighting for lives and values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Just Cause is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;affirmative (not against something) and optimistic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inspiring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inclusive: serves as an invitation to join others in advancing a cause bigger than ourselves. A clear Cause is what ignites our passions. Infinite-minded leaders actively seek out employees, customers and investors who share a passion for the Just Cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service oriented - for the primary benefit of others, not company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resilient - independent of any physical produce or services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idealistic - no matter how much we have achieved, we always feel we have further to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Responsibility of A Business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responsibility of business is to use its will and resources to advance a cause greater than itself, protect the
people and places in which it operates and generate more resources so that it can continue doing all those things for as
long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;✅ A Just Cause Based Capitalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Smith proposed a just cause based capitalism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumption is the sole purpose of producer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &quot;invisible-hand&quot; ultimately gets customer the best product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;❌ An Abused Capitalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proposed by Nobel Prize winner Friedman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The few people who control mega resources and abuse the system for personal gain is the sole purpose of producer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term finite-game mindset is then promoted throughout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More severely, that leads to the many of the mistreatment of customers and employees to become normalized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ethical Fading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Ethical Fading]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical fading is a condition in a culture that allows people to act in unethical ways in order to advance their own
interests, often at the expense of others, while falsely believing that they have not compromised their own moral
principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical fading often starts with small, seemingly innocuous transgressions that, when left unchecked, continue to grow
and compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the financial performance pressure, organizations bend rules and incentivize/pressurize employees for meeting the
goals without consideration of the manner in which they met their goals. This sends a message to everyone else in the
organization that making the numbers is more important than acting ethically. Employees, who might have family to feed
or pressures from all kinds of aspects of their lives, tend to rationalize such misbehaviors and, in the long run, the
snow ball grows to an organizational-wide extreme case, such as Wells Fargo whose thousands of employees engaged
deceptive activities against their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;When Structure Replaces Leadership&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Lazy Leadership]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; that was implemented as a solution when problem (performance lags, mistakes are made or unethical
decisions are uncovered) arises in company, rather than the people are supported by diligent leadership. This kind of
solution is called &lt;strong&gt;Lazy Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; is to ask employee to fill timesheet so that company can keep track of how much salary-hours
they worked. It&apos;s easier to trust a process than to trust people. When leaders use process to replace judgment, they
create conditions favorable to ethical fading, because people can play with the process system to generate
&quot;false-positive&quot; report, such as a mis-filled timesheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; is great for managing a supply chain. Procedure helps improve manufacturing
efficiencies. Ethical fading, however, is a people problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best antidote against ethical fading is an infinite mindset&lt;/strong&gt;. Leaders who give their people a
&lt;a href=&quot;#just-cause&quot;&gt;Just Cause&lt;/a&gt; to advance and give them an opportunity to work with a Trusting Team to advance it will build
a culture in which their people can work toward the short-term goals while also considering the morality, ethics and
wider impact of the decisions they make to meet those goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auf welche Art und durch welche Mittel sich auch immer eine Erkenntniss auf Gegenstände beziehen mag, die Anschauung.
Diese findet aber nur statt, so fern uns der Gegenstand gegeben wird; dieses aber ist wiederum nur dadurch möglich, dass
er das Gemüth auf gewisse Weise  afficire. Die Fähigkeit, Vorstellungen durch die Art, wie wir von Gegenstände afficirt
werden, zu bekommen, heisst Sinnlichkeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Die Fähigkeit, Vorstellungen durch die Art, wie wir von Gegenstände afficirt werden, zu bekommen, heisst Sinnlichkeit.]
Die Fähigkeit heisst Sinnlichkeit. → Die Fähigkeit, Vorstellungen durch die Art zu bekommen, heisst Sinnlichkeit. →
Welche Art? wie wir von Gegenstände afficirt werden.
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vermittelst der Sinnlichkeit also werden uns Gegenstände gegeben, und sie allein liefert uns Anschauungen; durch den
Verstand aber werden sie gedacht, und von ihm entspringen Begriffe. Alles Denken aber muss sich vermittelst gewisser
Merkmale, zuletzt auf Anschauungen beziehen, weil uns auf andere Weise kein Gegenstand gegeben werden kann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Wirkung eines Gegenstandes auf die Vorstellungsfähigkeit ist Empfindung. Diejenige Anschauung heisst empirisch. Der
unbestimmte Gegenstand einer empirischen Anschauung heisst Erscheinung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In der Erscheinung nennt Kant das die Materie, dasjenige aber, welches macht, dass das Mannigfaltige der Erscheinung
nennt Kant die &lt;strong&gt;Form&lt;/strong&gt; der Erscheinung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da das, worinnen sich die Empfindungen allein ordnen und in gewisse Form gestellt werden können, nicht Empfindung sein
kann, so ist uns die Materie aller Erscheinung nur a &lt;em&gt;posteriori&lt;/em&gt; gegeben, aber die Form muss im Gemüt &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; bereit
liegen, und abgesondert von aller Empfindung können betrachtet werden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kant nennt alle Vorstellungen rein, in dene nichts, was zur Empfindung gehört, angetroffen wird. Demnach wird die reine
Form sinnlicher Anschauungen überhaupt im Gemüthe &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; angetroffen werden, worinnen alles Mannigfaltige der
Erscheinungen in gewissen Verhältnissen angeschaut wird. Diese reine Form der Sinnlichkeit wird auch selber reine
Anschauung heissen. So, wenn wir von der Vorstellung eines Körpers absondern, so bleibt mir aus dieser empirischen
Anschauung noch etwas übrig, nämlich Ausdehnuug und Gestalt. Diese gehören zur reinen Auschauung, die &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, auch
ohne einen wirklichen Gegenstand der Sinne oder Empfindung, als eine blosse Form der Sinnlichkeit im Gemüthe
stattfindet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eine Wissenschaft von allen Principien der Sinnlichkeit &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; nennt Kant die transscendentale
&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/6lOwHdydgi4&quot;&gt;Aesthetik&lt;/a&gt;. Es muss also eine solche Wissenschaft geben in Gegensatz mit derjenigen,
welche die Principien des reinen Denkens enthält, und transscendentale Logik genannt wird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuerst in der transscendentalen Aesthetik also werden wir die Sinnlichkeit isoliren, dadurch, dass wir alles absondern,
was der Verstand durch seine Begriffe dabei denkt, damit nichts als empirische Anschauung übrig bleibe. Zweitens werden
wir von dieser noch alles (was zur Empfindung gehört) abtrennen, damit nichts als reine Anschauung und die blosse Form
der Erscheinungen übrig bleibe. Bei dieser Untersuchung wird sich finden zwei reinen Formen sinnlicher Anschauung (als
Principien der Erkenntniss &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; gebe), nämlich &lt;a href=&quot;#von-dem-raume&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; und &lt;strong&gt;Zeit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Overview of Leibniz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz&lt;/em&gt; is a very interesting many-sided man (or more easily known as the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/c/rkU6jLnK&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;German Genius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). He may have been the first computer scientist and information
theorist[^2]. He puzzled over the origins of the Slavic languages and was fascinated by classical Chinese. Leibniz was
also an expert in the Sanskrit language.[^2] He was also perhaps the first major European intellectual to take a close
interest in Chinese civilization[^2], which he knew by corresponding with, and reading other works by, European
Christian missionaries posted in China. He apparently read
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Couplet&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confucius Sinarum Philosophus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the first year of its publication.
He came to the conclusion that Europeans could learn much from the Confucian ethical tradition. He mulled over the
possibility that the Chinese characters were an unwitting form of his
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis&quot;&gt;universal characteristic&lt;/a&gt;. He noted how the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching&quot;&gt;I Ching&lt;/a&gt; (易经) hexagrams correspond to the binary numbers from 000000 to
111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical
mathematics he admired. Leibniz was one of the western philosophers of the time who attempted to accommodate Confucian
ideas to prevailing European beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./Diagram_of_I_Ching_hexagrams_owned_by_Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz,_1701.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diagram of I Ching hexagrams sent to Leibniz from Joachim Bouvet. The Arabic numerals were added by Leibniz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leibniz&apos;s attraction to Chinese philosophy originates from his perception that Chinese philosophy was similar to his own
The historian E.R. Hughes suggests that Leibniz&apos;s ideas of &quot;simple substance&quot; and
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-established_harmony&quot;&gt;pre-established harmony&lt;/a&gt;&quot; were directly influenced by
Confucianism, pointing to the fact that they were conceived during the period when he was reading &lt;em&gt;Confucius Sinarum
Philosophus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theodicy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On page 138 of &lt;em&gt;Theodicy&lt;/em&gt;, the only book-length treatise that he published during his lifetime[^3], Leibniz wrote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hence the conclusion that God wills all good in himself antecedently, that he wills the best consequently as an end,
that he wills what is indifferent, and physical evil, sometimes as a means, but that he will only permit
moral evil as the sine quo non or as a hypothetical necessity which connects it with the best. Therefore the
consequent will of God, which has sin for its object, is only permissive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leibniz thinks that the world that we live in is ABSOLUTELY the best possible world because it was created by a perfect
God. That means that there is no &quot;excess&quot; evil; evil always serves some sort of purpose. This has a lot to do with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_sufficient_reason&quot;&gt;The Principal of Sufficient Reason&lt;/a&gt;. Evil can exist in a
perfect world because it has sufficient reason to be there. In fact the evil is necessary. He argues this in a few ways.
Evil is necessary for a true type of free will. For free will to be truly admirable the individual needs to be able to
choose from a full range of options (not just good ones). He also says that some ultimate goods (like free will, but we
can think of others like courage, forgiveness, compassion) need suffering in order to exist. The evil is necessary. So
God would allow for these evils in order to make greater good possible[^1].&lt;/p&gt;

There was a scene in the movie when two torpedoes were fired approaching the destroyer Captain Krause was on. Within a
flash of seconds, he ordered the proceeding course of direction of the ship which eventually have both torpedoes missed

&lt;p&gt;There is large number of edits Kennedy had made to the inaugural speech now on display in the museum of John F. Kennedy
library in Boston. The speech, delivered on January 20, 1961, was the fourth shortest inaugural address in presidential
history. And JFK wanted it that way. &quot;I don&apos;t want people to think I&apos;m a windbag,&quot; Kennedy told his speechwriter, Ted
Sorensen. &quot;Make it short.&quot; Think about it. Kennedy&apos;s speech was 13 minutes and 42 seconds. One of the greatest speeches
in American history is four minutes shorter than a TED talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy made 31 changes in the last few hours, and most were aimed at streamlining the language. You can see the edits
in red. Until the last minute Kennedy was crossing out phrases, replacing long words with short ones, and eliminating
entire sentences. For example, Kennedy crossed out the following sentence: &quot;The world is very different now, empowered
as it is to banish all form of human poverty and all form of human life.&quot; Kennedy removed the words &quot;empowered&quot; and &quot;
banish&quot; and wrote a simpler, stronger sentence that sounds better to the ear: &quot;For man holds in his mortal hands the
power to abolish all form of human poverty and all form of human life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most famous line even went through edits. Kennedy crossed out &quot;will&quot; and replaced it with &quot;can.&quot; He cut out three
words, too. The sentence finally read: &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.&quot;
As noted above, while the concept is profound, the sentence is made up of short words that a fourth-grader could read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another famous sentence tests at a third-grade readability level because it&apos;s made up of mostly one-syllable words: &quot;We
shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe…&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if Kennedy had been speaking in the language of contemporary politics. He might have said, &quot;We should consider
the effort to be worth any cost or encumbrance associated with the initiative…&quot; If he had, we would not have remembered
the speech. Fewer, shorter words are more memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy studied two speechmakers to sharpen his writing skills: &lt;strong&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/strong&gt;. Lincoln
was a master storyteller. It&apos;s said that crowds of villagers from far and wide would flock to his events when he was
running for president. Great orators stir the soul, and Lincoln was one of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman,
Reverend Clergy, fellow citizens:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom--symbolizing an end as well as a
beginning--signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our
forbears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and
all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around
the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place,
to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered
by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the
slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today
at home and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any
hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This much we pledge--and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United
there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided there is little we can do--for we dare not meet
a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall
not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them
supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom--and to remember that,
in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our
best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required--not because the communists may be doing it,
not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot
save the few who are rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge--to convert our good words into good deeds--in a
new alliance for progress--to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this
peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with
them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power know that this Hemisphere
intends to remain the master of its own house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of
war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support--to prevent it from becoming merely a
forum for invective--to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak--and to enlarge the area in which its writ may
run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides
begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in
planned or accidental self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt
that they will never be employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course--both sides overburdened
by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter
that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind&apos;s final war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let us begin anew--remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject
to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms--and
bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer
the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah--to &quot;undo the heavy burdens . . . (and)
let the oppressed go free.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor,
not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace
preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor
in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this
country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The
graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the trumpet summons us again--not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need--not as a call to battle, though
embattled we are-- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, &quot;rejoicing in hope,
patient in tribulation&quot;--a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more
fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of
maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility--I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange
places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this
endeavor will light our country and all who serve it--and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of
man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of
strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of
our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth
God&apos;s work must truly be our own.&lt;/p&gt;

:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Frost wrote that John F. Kennedy&apos;s election heralded &quot;a golden age of poetry and power&quot;. Frost was right. In
the speeches that Kennedy delivered to inspire the country to build a moon program, Kennedy translated his ideas into
language that fueled one of the greatest achievements in human history. Recently scholars have identified some of his
most effective rhetorical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wharton management professor Andrew Carton stumbled upon Mars&apos;s story as he pored over 18,000 pages of documents,
transcripts, and internal NASA memos from the Apollo program, America&apos;s ambitious initiative, begun in 1961, to put a
man on the moon. Carton noted a common thread among the writings of Mars and the other NASA employees across all
functions - accountants and administrators, clerks and engineers. They&apos;d all been profoundly inspired by the words of
one man: John F. Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carton identified the rhetorical formula behind Kennedy&apos;s successful communication and explained how his speaking skills
triggered massive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, &quot;Kennedy reduced the number of NASA&apos;s aspirations to one.&quot; When NASA was established in 1958, it had several
objectives, among them to establish superior space technology, to achieve preeminence in space, and to advance
science. Kennedy chose to focus on the single goal of sending humans to the moon and returning them safely to Earth.
&lt;strong&gt;It&apos;s easier to rally a team around one common goal than to divide their attention&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, &quot;Kennedy shifted attention from NASA&apos;s ultimate aspiration to a concrete objective.&quot; In other words, Kennedy
took the abstract (advancing science by exploring the solar system) and made it tangible. On May 25, 1961, Kennedy
told the U.S. Congress: &quot;This nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of
landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.&quot; Kennedy articulated &lt;strong&gt;a concrete goal and attached a
specific deadline&lt;/strong&gt; to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, &quot;Kennedy communicated milestones that connected employees&apos; day-to-day work with concrete objectives.&quot;
Kennedy outlined three programs and three objectives: The Mercury program would send an astronaut into orbit; Gemini
would teach NASA what it didn&apos;t know about space walks and connecting two spacecrafts together; and Apollo would
ultimately put a man on the moon. The &quot;&lt;strong&gt;rule of three&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; is a powerful communication technique that superstar
persuaders use to mobilize their listeners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourth, &quot;Kennedy emphasized the impressive scale of the objective with metaphors, analogies and unique figures of
speech.&quot; Kennedy relied on a rarely used technique that linguists call &quot;embodied concept.&quot; &lt;strong&gt;It binds a concrete
event (landing on the moon) with an abstract aspiration (advancing science)&lt;/strong&gt;. The abstract and concrete become one
and the same. For example, in a speech at Rice University in 1962, Kennedy said, &quot;Space is there and we&apos;re going to
climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.&quot; Kennedy gave
abstract ideals like knowledge, peace, and exploration a real location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four steps proved to be irresistibly persuasive. Kennedy’s &quot;soft&quot; skill led to one of the greatest achievements in
the history of humanity. His words gave NASA employees a stronger connection between their work and the ultimate goal.
They no longer saw their work as an isolated series of tasks like mopping the floors or building electrical circuits.
Instead, they viewed their work as a critical component of putting a man on the moon, advancing science, and changing
the world as we know it. &quot;In this way, Kennedy positioned employees to experience greater meaningfulness from their work
by changing the meaning of work,&quot; says Carton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960s, skeptics outnumbered those who believed a person could set foot on the moon by the end of the
decade. Kennedy didn’t persuade people with facts alone; he made them feel. He combined what Aristotle called Pathos and
Logos: emotion and logic. Kennedy’s words achieved emotional transcendence, making people believe that the impossible
was possible. Skeptics became believers and believers became evangelists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Great Speech&lt;/h2&gt;

:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Pitzer, Mr. Vice President, Governor, Congressman Thomas, Senator Wiley, and Congressman Miller, Mr. Webb. Mr.
Bell, scientists, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor, and I will assure you that my first lecture
will be very brief. I am delighted to be here and I&apos;m particularly delighted to be here on this occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet at a college noted for knowledge, in a city noted for progress, in a State noted for strength, and we stand in
need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both
knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today, despite
the fact that this Nation&apos;s own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times
that of our population as a whole, despite that, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished
still far out-strip our collective comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come, but condense, if you will, the 50,000 years of man&apos;s recorded
history in a time span of but a half century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years,
except at the end of them advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them. Then about 10 years ago,
under this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter. Only 5 years ago man learned to
write and use a cart with wheels. Christianity began less than 2 years ago. The printing press came this year, and then
less than 2 months ago, during this whole 50-year span of human history, the steam engine provided a new source of
power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newton explored the meaning of gravity. Last month electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became
available. Only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power, and now if America&apos;s new
spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a breathtaking pace, and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old, new ignorance, new
problems, new dangers. Surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships, as well as high reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But this city of
Houston, this State of Texas, this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished
to look behind them. This country was conquered by those who moved forward-and so will space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony, said that all great and honorable actions
are accompanied with great difficulties, and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything, it is that man, in his quest for knowledge and progress, is
determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one
of the great adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay
behind in this race for space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first
waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to founder in the
backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it - we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the world now look
into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag
of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass
destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first, and, therefore, we intend to be first.
In short, our leadership in science and in industry, our hopes for peace and security, our obligations to ourselves as
well as others, all require us to make this effort, to solve these mysteries, to solve them for the good of all men, and
to become the world&apos;s leading space-faring nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won
and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience
of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a
position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of
war. I do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go
unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding
the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its
conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why,
some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain. Why, 35 years
ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are
easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and
skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we
intend to win, and the others, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as
among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the Office of the Presidency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man&apos;s
history. We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket, many times
as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their
accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where five F-1 rocket engines, each one as powerful as all eight
engines of the Saturn combined, will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn missile, assembled in a new
building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48-story structure, as wide as a city block, and as long as two
lengths of this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within these last 19 months at least 45 satellites have circled the earth. Some 40 of them were &quot;made in the United
States of America&quot; and they were far more sophisticated and supplied far more knowledge to the people of the world than
those of the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mariner spacecraft now on its way to Venus is the most intricate instrument in the history of space science. The
accuracy of that shot is comparable to firing a missile from Cape Canaveral and dropping it in this stadium between the
40-yard lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transit satellites are helping our ships at sea to steer a safer course. Tiros satellites have given us unprecedented
warnings of hurricanes and storms, and will do the same for forest fires and icebergs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had our failures, but so have others, even if they do not admit them. And they may be less public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, we are behind, and will be behind for some time in manned flight. But we do not intend to stay behind, and
in this decade we shall make up and move ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and environment, by new
techniques of learning and mapping and observation, by new tools and computers for industry, medicine, the home as well
as the school. Technical institutions, such as Rice, will reap the harvest of these gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the space effort itself, while still in its infancy, has already created a great number of new companies,
and tens of thousands of new jobs. Space and related industries are generating new demands in investment and skilled
personnel, and this city and this State, and this region, will share greatly in this growth. What was once the furthest
outpost on the old frontier of the West will be the furthest outpost on the new frontier of science and space. Houston,
your City of Houston, with its Manned Spacecraft Center, will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering
community. During the next 5 years the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to double the number of
scientists and engineers in this area, to increase its outlays for salaries and expenses to $60 million a year; to
invest some $200 million in plant and laboratory facilities; and to direct or contract for new space efforts over $1
billion from this Center in this City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, all this costs us all a good deal of money. This year&apos;s space budget is three times what it was in January
1961, and it is greater than the space budget of the previous 8 years combined. That budget now stands at $5,400 million
a year-a staggering sum, though somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year. Space expenditures will
soon rise some more from 40 cents per person per week to more than 50 cents a week for every man, woman, and child in
the United States, for we have given this program a high national priority even though I realize that this is in some
measure an act of faith and vision, for we do not now know what benefits await us. But if I were to say, my fellow
citizens, that we shall send to the moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston, a giant rocket more
than 300 feet tall, the length of this football field, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been
invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with
a precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance, control,
communications, food and survival, on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to
earth, reentering the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat about half that of the
temperature of the sun - almost as hot as it is here today - and do all this, and do it right, and do it first before
this decade is out, then we must be bold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m the one who is doing all the work, so we just want you to stay cool for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think we&apos;re going to do it, and I think that we must pay what needs to be paid. I don&apos;t think we ought to
waste any money, but I think we ought to do the job. And this will be done in the decade of the sixties. It may be done
while some of you are still here at school at this college and university. It will be done during the terms of office of
some of the people who sit here on this platform. But it will be done. And it will be done before the end of this
decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted that this university is playing a part in putting a man on the moon as part of a great national effort of
the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to
climb it. He said, &quot;Because it is there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, space is there, and we&apos;re going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge
and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God&apos;s blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and
greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The President spoke in the Rice University Stadium at 10 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his opening words he referred to Dr. K. S. Pitzer, President of the University, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson,
Governor Price Daniel of Texas, Representative Albert Thomas of Texas, Senator Alexander Wiley of Wisconsin,

&lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/c/cj3d6g2A&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Infinite Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. New York: Portfolio/Penguin, 2019. ISBN 9780735213500, Chapter
2 - What a Just Cause Is - For something -- affirmative and optimistic
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Just Cause is something we stand for and believe in, not something we oppose. Leaders can rally people &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt;
something quite easily. They can whip them into a frenzy, even. For our emotions can run hot when we are angry or
afraid. Being &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; something, in contrast, is about feeling inspired. Being &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; ignites the human spirit and fills us
with hope and optimism. Being against is about vilifying, demonizing or rejecting. Being &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; is about inviting all to
join in common cause. Being &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; focuses our attention on the things we can see in order to elicit reactions. Being
for focuses our attention on the unbuilt future in order to spark our imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if instead of fighting &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; poverty, for example, we fought &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the right of every human to provide for
their own family. The first creates a common enemy, something we are against. It sets up the Cause as if it is
&quot;winnable,&quot; i.e., a finite game. It leads us to believe that we can defeat poverty once and for all. The second gives us
a cause to advance. The impact of the two perspectives is more than semantics. It affects how we view the problem/vision
that affects our ideas on how we can contribute. Where the first offers us a problem to solve, the second offers a
vision of possibility, dignity and empowerment. We are not inspired to &quot;reduce&quot; poverty, we are inspired to &quot;grow&quot; the
number of people who are able to provide for themselves and their families. Being for or being against is a subtle but
profound difference that the writers of the Declaration of Independence intuitively understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who led America toward independence stood &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; Great Britain in the short term. Indeed the American colonists
were deeply offended by how they were treated by England. Over 60 percent of the Declaration of Independence is spent
laying out specific grievances against the king. However, the Cause they were fighting &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; was the true source of
lasting inspiration, and in the Declaration of Independence it came before anything else. It is the first idea we read
in the document. It sets the context for the rest of the Declaration and the direction for moving forward. It is the
ideal to which we personally relate and that we have easily committed to memory. Few Americans, except for scholars and
the most zealous of history buffs, can rattle off even one of the complaints listed later in the document, things like:
&quot;He has endeavored to prevent the Population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for naturalization
of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their Migrations hither, and raising the Conditions of new
Appropriations of Lands.&quot; In contrast, most Americans can recite with ease &quot;all men are created equal&quot; and can usually
rattle off the three tenets of &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot; These words are indelibly marked on the
cultural psyche. Invoked by patriots and politicians alike, they remind Americans of who we strive to be and the ideals
upon which our nation was founded. They tell us what we stand &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

agendum facultatis tantum, quantum homini vigilanti ex forensi usu prope cotidiana dicendi exercitatio potuit adferre,
certe et si quid auctoritatis in me est, apud eos utar qui eam mihi dederunt, et si quid in dicendo consequi possum, eis
ostendam potissimum, qui ei quoque rei fructum suo iudicio tribuendum esse duxerunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atque illud in primis mihi laetandum iure esse video, quod in hac insolita mihi ex hoc loco ratione dicendi causa talis
oblata est, in qua oratio deesse nemini possit. Dicendum est enim de Cn. Pompei singulari eximiaque virtute: huius autem
orationis difficilius est exitum quam principium invenire. Ita mihi non tam copia quam modus in dicendo quaerendus est.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atque,--ut inde oratio mea proficiscatur, unde haec omnis causa ducitur,--bellum grave et periculosum vestris
vectigalibus ac sociis a duobus potentissimis regibus infertur, Mithridate et Tigrane, quorum alter relictus, alter
lacessitus, occasionem sibi ad occupandam Asiam oblatam esse arbitrantur. Equitibus Romanis, honestissimis viris,
adferuntur ex Asia cotidie litterae, quorum magnae res aguntur in vestris vectigalibus exercendis occupatae: qui ad me,
pro necessitudine quae mihi est cum illo ordine, causam rei publicae periculaque rerum suarum detulerunt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bithyniae, quae nunc vestra provincia est, vicos exustos esse compluris; regnum Ariobarzanis, quod finitimum est vestris
vectigalibus, totum esse in hostium potestate; L. Lucullum, magnis rebus gestis, ab eo bello discedere; huic qui
successerit non satis esse paratum ad tantum bellum administrandum; unum ab omnibus sociis et civibus ad id bellum
imperatorem deposci atque expeti, eundem hunc unum ab hostibus metui, praeterea neminem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Causa quae sit videtis: nunc quid agendum sit considerate. Primum mihi videtur de genere belli, deinde de magnitudine,
tum de imperatore deligendo esse dicendum. Genus est belli eius modi, quod maxime vestros animos excitare atque
inflammare ad persequendi studium debeat: in quo agitur populi Romani gloria, quae vobis a maioribus cum magna in
omnibus rebus tum summa in re militari tradita est; agitur salus sociorum atque amicorum, pro qua multa maiores vestri
magna et gravia bella gesserunt; aguntur certissma populi Romani vectigalia et maxima, quibus amissis et pacis ornamenta
et subsidia belli requiretis; aguntur bona multorum civium, quibus est a vobis et ipsorum et rei publicae causa
consulendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et quoniam semper appetentes gloriae praeter ceteras gentis atque avidi laudis fuistis, delenda est vobis ill macula
Mithridatico bello superiore concepta, quae penitus iam insedit ac nimis inveteravit in populi Romani nomine,--quod is,
qui uno die, tota in Asia, tot in civitatibus, uno nuntio atque una significatione [litterarum] civis Romanos necandos
trucidandosque denotavit, non modo adhuc poenam nullam suo dignam scelere suscepit, sed ab illo tempore annum iam
tertium et vicesimum regnat, et ita regnat, ut se non Ponti neque Cappadociae latebris occultare velit, sed emergere ex
patrio regno atque in vestris vectigalibus, hoc est, in Asiae luce versari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etenim adhuc ita nostri cum illo rege contenderunt imperatores, ut ab illo insignia victoriae, non victoriam
reportarent. Triumphavit L. Sulla, triumphavit L. Murena de Mithridate, duo fortissimi viri et summi imperatores; sed
ita triumpharunt, ut ille pulsus superatusque regnaret. Verum tamen illis imperatoribus laus est tribuenda quod egerunt,
venia dandaquod reliquerunt, propterea quod ab eo bello Sullam in Italiam res publica, Murenam Sulla revocavit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mithridates autem omne reliquum tempus non ad oblivionem veteris belli, sed ad comparationem novi contulit: qui [postea]
cum maximas aedificasset ornassetque classis exercitusque permagnos quibuscumque ex gentibus potuisset comparasset, et
se Bosporanis finitimis suis bellum inferre similaret, usque in Hispaniam legatos ac litteras misit ad eos duces
quibuscum tum bellum gerebamus, ut, cum duobus in locis disiunctissimis maximeque diversis uno consilio a binis hostium
copiis bellum terra marique gereretur, vos ancipiti contentione districti de imperio dimicaretis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sed tamen alterius partis periculum, Sertorianae atque Hispaniensis, quae multo plus firmamenti ac roboris habebat, Cn.
Pompei divino consilio ac singulari virtute depulsum est; in altera parte ita res a L. Lucullo summo viro est
administrata, ut initia illa rerum gestarum magna atque praeclara non felicitati eius, sed virtuti, haec autem extrema,
quae nuper acciderunt, non culpae, sed fortunae tribuenda esse videantur. Sed de Lucullo dicam alio loco, et ita dicam,
Quirites, ut neque vera laus ei detracta oratione mea neque falsa adficta esse videatur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;de vestri imperi dignitate atque gloria--quoniam is est exorsus orationis meae-- videte quem vobis animum suscipiendum
putetis. Maiores nostri saepe mercatoribus aut naviculariis nostris iniuriosius tractatis bella gesserunt: vos, tot
milibus civium Romanorum uno nuntio atque uno tempore necatis, quo tandem animo esse debetis? Legati quod erant
appellati superbius, Corinthum patres vestri totius Graeciae lumen exstinctum esse voluerunt: vos eum regem inultum esse
patiemini, qui legatum populi Romani consularem vinculis ac verberibus atque omni supplicio excruciatum necavit? Illi
libertatem imminutam civium Romanorum non tulerunt: vos ereptam vitam neglegetis? ius legationis verbo violatum illi
persecuti sunt: vos legatum omni supplicio interfectum relinquetis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videte ne, ut illis pulcherrimum fuit tantam vobis imperi gloriam tradere, sic vobis turpissimum sit, id quod accepistis
tueri et conservare non posse. Quid? quod salus sociorum summum in periculum ac discrimen vocatur, quo tandem animo
ferre debetis? Regno est expulsus Ariobarzanes rex, socius populi Romani atque amicus; imminent duo reges toti Asiae non
solum vobis inimicissimi, sed etiam vestris sociis atque amicis; civitates autem omnes cuncta Asia atque Graecia vestrum
auxilium exspectare propter periculi magnitudinem coguntur; imperatorem a vobis certum deposcere, cum praesertim vos
alium miseritis, neque audent, neque se id facere sine summo periculo posse arbitrantur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vident et sentiunt hoc idem quod vos,--unum virum esse, in quo summa sint omnia, et eum propter esse, quo etiam carent
aegrius; cuius adventus ipso atque nomine, tametsi ille ad maritimum bellum venerit, tamen impetus hostium repressos
esse intellegunt ac retardatos. His vos, quoniam libere loqui non licet, tacite rogant, ut se quoque, sicut ceterarum
provinciarum socios, dignos existimetis, quorum salutem tali viro commendetis; atque hoc etiam magis, quod ceteros in
provinciam eius modi homines cum imperio mittimus, ut etiam si ab hoste defendant, tamen ipsorum adventus in urbis
sociorum non multum ab hostili expugnatione differant. Hunc audiebant antea, nunc praesentem vident, tanta temperantia,
tanta mansuetudine, tanta humanitate, ut ei beatissimi esse videantur, apud quod ille diutissime commoratur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qua re si propter socios, nulla ipsi iniuria lacessiti, maiores nostri cum Antiocho, cum Philippo, cum Aetolis, cum
Poenis bella gesserunt, quanto vos studio convenit iniuriis provocatos sociorum salutem una cum imperi vestri dignitate
defendere, praesertim cum de maximis vestris vectigalibus agatur? Nam ceterarum provinciarum vectigalia, Quirites, tanta
sunt, ut eis ad ipsas provincias tutandas vix contenti esse possimus: Asia vero tam opima est ac fertilis, ut et
ubertate agrorum et varietate fructuum et magnitudine pastionis et multitudine earum rerum quae exportantur, facile
omnibus terris antecellat. Itaque haec vobis provincia, Quirites, si et belli utilitatem et pacis dignitatem retinere
voltis, non modo a calamitate, sed etiam a metu calamitatis est defenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nam in ceteris rebus cum venit calamitas, tum detrimentum accipitur; at in vectigalibus non solum adventus mali, sed
etiam metus ipse adfert calamitatem. Nam cum hostium copiae non longe absunt, etiam si inruptio nulla facta est, tamen
pecuaria relinquitur, agri cultura deseritur, mercatorum navigatio conquiescit. Ita neque ex portu neque ex decumis
neque ex scriptura vectigal conservari potest: qua re saepe totius anni fructus uno rumore periculi atque uno belli
terrore amittitur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quo tandem igitur animo esse existimatis aut eos qui vectigalia nobis pensitant, aut eos qui exercent atque exigunt, cum
duo reges cum maximis copiis propter adsint? cum una excursio equitatus perbrevi tempore totius anni vectigal auferre
possit? cum publicani familias maximas, quas in saltibus habent, quas in agris, quas in portubus atque custodiis, magno
periculo se habere arbitrentur? Putatisne vos illis rebus frui posse, nisi eos qui vobis fructui sunt conservaritis non
solum (ut ante dixi) calamitate, sed etiam calamitatis formidine liberatos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ac ne illud quidem vobis neglegendum est, quod mihi ego extremum proposueram, cum essem de belli genere dicturus, quod
ad multorum bona civium Romanorum pertinet, quorum vobis pro vesta sapientia, Quirites, habenda est ratio diligenter.
Nam et publicani, homines honestissimi atque ornatissimi, suas rationes et copias in illam provinciam contulerunt,
quorum ipsorum per se res et fortunae vobis curae esse debent. Etenim si vectigalia nervos esse rei publicae semper
duximus, eum certe ordinem, qui exercet illa, firmamentum ceterorum ordinum recte esse dicemus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deinde ex ceteris ordinibus homines gnavi atque industrii partim ipsi in Asia negotiantur, quibus vos absentibus
consulere debetis, partim eorum in ea provincia pecunias magnas conlocatas habent. Est igitur humanitatis vestrae magnum
numerum eorum civium calamitate prohibere, sapientiae videre multorum civium calamitatem a re publica seiunctam esse non
posse. Etenim primum illud parvi refert, vos publicanis amissa vectigalia postea victoria recuperare; neque enim isdem
redimendi facultas erit propter calamitatem, neque aliis voluntas propter timorem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deinde quod nos eadem Asia atque idem iste Mithridates initio belli Asiatici docuit, id quidem certe calamitate docti
memoria retinere debemus. Nam tum, cum in Asia res magnas permulti, amiserant, scimus Romae, solutione impedita, fidem
concidisse. Non enim possunt una in civitate multi rem ac fortunas amittere, ut non plures secum in eandem trahant
calamitatem. A quo periculo prohibete rem publicam, et mihi credite id quod ipsi videtis: haec fides atque haec ratio
pecuniarum, quae Romae, quae in foro versatur, implicata est cum illis pecuniis Asiaticis et cohaeret. Ruere illa non
possunt, ut haec non eodem labefacta motu concidant. Qua re videte num dubitandum vobis sit omni studio ad id bellum
incumbere, in quo gloria nominis vestri, salus sociorum, vectigalia maxima, fortunae plurimorum civium coniunctae cum re
publica defendantur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoniam de genere belli dixi, nunc de magnitudine pauca dicam. Potest hoc enim dici, belli genus esse ita necessarium ut
sit gerendum, non esse ita magnum ut sit pertimescendum. In quo maxime elaborandum est, ne forte ea vobis quae
diligentissime providenda sunt, contemnenda esse videantur. Atque ut omnes intellegant me L. Lucullo tantum impertire
laudis, quantum forti viro et sapienti homini et magno imperatori debeatur, dico eius adventu maximas Mithridati copias
omnibus rebus ornatus atque instructas fuisse, urbemque Asiae clarissimam nobisque amicissimam, Cyzicenorum, obsessam
esse ab ipso rege maxima multitudine et oppugnatam vehementissime, quam L. Lucullus virtute, adsiduitate, consilio,
summis obsidionis periculis liberavit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ab eodem imperatore classem magnam et ornatam, quae ducibus Sertorianis ad Italiam studio atque odio inflammata
raperetur, superatam esse atque depressami magnas hostium praeterea copias multis proeliis esse deletas, patefactumque
nostris legionibs esse Pontum, qui antea populo Romano ex omni aditu clausus fuisset; Sinopen atque Amisum, quibus in
oppidis erant domicilia regis, omnibus rebus ornatus ac refertas, ceterasque urbis Ponti et Cappadociae permultas, uno
aditu adventuque esse captas; regem, spoliatum regno patrio atque avito, ad alios se reges atque ad alias gentis
supplicem contulisse; atque haec omnia salvis populi Romani sociis atque integris vectigalibus esse gesta. Satis opinor
haec esse laudis, atque ita, Quirites, ut hoc vos intellegatis, a nullo istorum, qui huic obtrectant legi atque causae,
L. Lucullum similiter ex hoc loco esse laudatum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requiretur fortasse nunc quem ad modum, cum haec ita sint, reliquum possit magnum esse bellum. Cognoscite, Quirites. Non
enim hoc sine causa quaeri videtur. Primum ex suo regno sic Mithridates profugit, ut ex eodem Ponto Medea illa quondam
profugisse dicitur, quam praedicant in fuga fratris sui membra in eis locis, qua se parens persequeretur, dissipavisse,
ut eorum conlectio dispersa, maerorque patrius, celeritatem persequendi retardaret. Sic Mithridates fugiens maximam vim
auri atque argenti pulcherrimarumque rerum omnium, quas et a maioribus acceperat et ipse bello superiore ex tota Asia
direptas in suum regnum congesserat, in Ponto omnem reliquit. Haec dum nostri conligunt omnia diligentius, rex ipse e
manibus effugit. Ita illum in persequendi studio maeror, hos laetitia tardavit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunc in illo timore et fuga Tigranes rex Armenius excepit, diffidentemque rebus suis confirmavit, et adflictum erexit,
perditumque recreavit. Cuius in regnum postea quam L. Lucullus cum exercitu venit, plures etiam gentes contra
imperatorem nostrum concitatae sunt. Erat enim metus iniectus eis nationibus, quas numquam populus Romanus neque
lacessendas bello neque temptandas putavit: erat etiam alia gravis atque vehemens opinio, quae animos gentium barbarum
pervaserat, fani locupletissimi et religiosissimi diripiendi causa in eas oras nostrum esse exercitum adductum. Ita
nationes multae atque magnae novo quodam terrore ac metu concitabantur. Noster autem exercitus, tametsi urbem ex Tigrani
regno ceperat, et proeliis usus erat secundis, tamen nimia longinquitate locorum ac desiderio suorum commovebatur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hic iam plura non dicam. Fuit enim illud extremum ut ex eis locis a militibus nostris reditus magis maturus quam
processio longior quaereretur. Mithridates autem et suam manum iam confirmarat, [et eorum] qui se ex ipsius regno
conlegerant, et magnis adventiciis auxiliis multorum regum et nationum iuvabatur. iam hoc fere sic fieri solere
accepimus, ut regem adflictae fortunae facile multorum opes adliciant ad misericordiam, maximeque eorum qui aut reges
sunt aut vivunt in regno, ut eis nomen regale magnum et sanctum esse videatur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itaque tantum victus efficere potuit, quantum incolumis numquam est ausus optare. Nam cum se in regnum suum recepisset,
non fuit eo contentus, quod ei praeter spem acciderat,--ut illam, postea quam pulsus erat, terram umquam
attingeret,--sed in exercitum nostrum clarum atque victorem impetum fecit. Sinite hoc loco, Quirites, sicut poetae
solent, qui res Romanas scribunt, praeterire me nostram calamitatem, quae tanta fuit, ut eam ad auris [Luculli]
imperatoris non ex proelio nuntius, sed ex sermone rumor adferret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hic in illo ipso malo gravissimaque belli offensione, L. Lucullus, qui tamen aliqua ex parte eis incommodis mederi
fortasse potuisset, vestro iussu coactus,--qui imperi diuturnitati modum statuendum vetere exemplo putavistis,--partem
militum, qui iam stipendiis confecti erant, dimisit, partem M&apos;. Glabrioni tradidit. Multa praetereo consulto, sed ea vos
coniectura perspicite, quantum illud bellum factum putetis, quod coniungant reges potentissimi, renovent agitatae
nationes, suscipiant integrae gentes, novus imperator noster accipiat, vetere exercitu pulso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satis mihi multa verba fecisse videor, qua re esset hoc bellum genere ipso necessarium, magnitudine periculosum. Restat
ut de imperatore ad id bellum delingendo ac tantis rebus praeficiendo dicendum esse videatur. Utinam, Quirites, virorum
fortium atque innocentium copiam tantam haberetis, ut haec vobis deliberatio difficilis esset, quemnam potissimum tantis
rebus ac tanto bello praeficiendum putaretis! Nunc vero--cum sit unus Cn. Pompeius, qui non modo eorum hominum qui nunc
sunt gloriam, sed etiam antiquitatis memoriam virtute superarit--quae res est quae cuiusquam animum in hac causa dubium
facere possit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ego enim sic existimo, in summo imperatore quattuor has res inesse oportere,--scientiam rei militaris, virtutem,
auctoritatem, felicitatem. Quis igitur hoc homine scientior umquam aut fuit aut esse debuit? qui e ludo atque e
pueritiae disciplinis bello maximo atque acerrimis hostibus ad patris exercitum atque in militiae disciplinam profectus
est; qui extrema pueritia miles in exercitu fuit simmi imperatoris, ineunte adulescentia maximi ipse exercitus
imperator; qui saepius cum hoste conflixit quam quisquam cum inimice concertavit, plura bello gessit quam ceteri
legerunt, plures provincias confecit quam alii concupiverunt; cuius adulescentia ad scientiam rei militaris non alienis
praeceptis sed suis imperiis, non offensionibus belli sed victoriis, non stipendiis sed triumphis est erudita. Quod
denique genus esse belli potest, in quo illum non exercuerit fortuna rei publicae? Civile, Africanum, Transalpinum,
Hispaniense [mixtum ex civitatibus atque ex bellicosissimis nationibus], servile, navale bellum, varia et diversa genera
et bellorum et hostium, non solum gesta ab hoc uno, sed etiam confecta, nullam rem esse declarant in usu positam
militari, quae huius viri scientiam fugere possit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iam vero virtuti Cn. Pompei quae potest oratio par inveniri? Quid est quod quisquam aut illo dignum aut vobis novum aut
cuiquam inauditum possit adferre? Neque enim illae sunt solae virtutes imperatoriae, quae volgo existimantur,--labor in
negotiis, fortitudo in periculis, industria in agendo, celeritas in conficiendo, consilium in providiendo: quae tanta
sunt in hoc uno, quanta in omnibus reliquis imperatoribus, quos aut vidimus aut audivimus, non fuerunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testis est Italia, quam ille ipse victor L. Sulla huius virtute et subsidio confessus est liberata. Testis est Sicilia,
quam multis undique cinctam periculis non terrore belli, sed consili celeritate explicavit. Testis est Africa, quae,
magnis oppressa hostium copiis, eorum ipsorum sanguine redundavit. Testis est Gallia, per quam legionibus nostris iter
in Hispaniam Gallorum internecione patefactum est. Testis est Hispania, quae saepissime plurimos hostis ab hoc superatos
prostratosque conspexit. Testis est iterum et saepius Italia, quae cum servili bello taetro periculosoque premeretur, ab
hoc auxilium absente expetivit: quod bellum exspectatione eius attentuatum atque imminutum est, adventu sublatum ac
sepultum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testes nunc vero iam omnes orae atque omnes exterae gentes ac nationes, denique maria omnia cum universa, tum in
singulis oris omnes sinus at portus. Quis enim toto mari locus per hos annos aut tam firmum habuit praesidium ut tutus
esset, aut tam fuit abditus ut lateret? Quis navigavit qui non se aut mortis aut servitutis periculo committeret, cum
aut hieme aut referto praedonum mari navigaret? Hoc tantum belum, tam turpe, tam vetus, tam late divisum atque
dispersum, quis umquam arbitraretur aut ab omnibus imperatoribus uno anno aut omnibus annis ab uno imperatore confici
posse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quam provinciam tenuistis a praedonibus liberam per hosce annos? quod vectigal vobis tutum fuit? quem socium
defendistis? cui praesidio classibus vestris fuistis? quam multas existimatis insulas esse desertas? quam multas aut
metu relictas aut a praedonibus captas urbis esse sociorum? Sed quid ego longinqua commemoro? Fuit hoc quondam, fuit
proprium populi Romani, longe a domo bellare, et propugnaculis imperi sociorum fortunas, non sua tecta defendere. Sociis
ego nostris mare per hos annos clausum fuisse dicam, cum exercitus vestri numquam a Brundisio nisi hieme summa
transmiserint? Qui ad vos ab exteris nationibus venirent captos querar, cum legati populi Romani redempti sint?
Mercatoribus tutum mare non fuisse dicam, cum duodecim secures in praedonum potestatem pervenerint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cnidum aut Colophonem aut Samum, nobilissimas urbis, innumerabilisque alias captas esse commemorem, cum vestros portus,
atque eos portus quibus vitam ac spiritum ducitis, in praedonum fuisse potestatem sciatis? An vero ignoratis portum
Caietae celeberrimum ac plenissimum navium inspectante praetore a praedonibus esse direptum? ex Miseno autem eius ipsius
liberos, qui cum praedonibus antea ibi bellum gesserat, a praedonibus esse sublatos? Nam quid ego Ostiense incommodum
atque illam labem atque ignominiam rei publicae querar, cum, prope inspectantibus vobis, classis ea, cui consul populi
Romani praepositus esset, a praedonibus capta atque oppressa est? Pro di immortales! tantamne unius hominis incredibilis
ac divina virtus tam brevi tempore lucem adferre rei publicae potuit, ut vos, qui modo anti ostium Tiberinum classem
hostium videbatis, ei nunc nullam intra Oceani ostium praedonum navem esse audiatis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atque haec qua celeritate gesta sint quamquam videtis, tamen a me in dicendo praetereunda non sunt. Quis enim umquam aut
obeundi negoti aut consequendi quaestus studio tam brevi tempore tot loca adire, tantos cursus conficere potuit, quam
celeriter Cn. Pompeio duce tanti belli impetus navigavit? Qui nondum tempestivo ad navigandum mari Siciliam adiit,
Africam exploravit; inde Sardiniam cum classe venit, atque haec tria frumentaria subsidia rei publicae firmissimis
praesidiis classibusque munivit;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inde cum se in Italiam recepisset, duabus Hispanis et Gallia [transalpina] praesidiis ac navibus confirmata, missis item
in oram Illyrici maris et in Achaiam omnemque Graeciam navibus, Italiae duo maria maximis classibus firmissimisque
praesidiis adornavit; ipse autem ut Brundisio profectus est, undequinquagesimo die totam ad imperium populi Romani
Ciliciam adiunxit; omnes, qui ubique praedones fuerunt, partim capti interfectique sunt, partim unius huius se imperio
ac potestati dediderunt. Idem Cretensibus, cum ad eum usque in Pamphyliam legatos deprecatoresque misissent, spem
deditionis non ademit, obsidesque imperavit. Ita tantum bellum, tam diuturunum, tam longe lateque dispersum, quo bello
omnes gentes ac nationes premebantur, Cn. Pompeius extrema hieme apparavit, ineunte vere susceptit, media aestate
confecit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Est haec divina atque incredibilis virtus imperatoris. Quid ceterae, quas paulo ante commemorare coeperam, quantae atque
quam multae sunt? Non enim bellandi virtus solum in summo ac perfecto imperatore quaerenda est, sed multae sunt artes
eximiae huius administrae comitesque virtutis. Ac primum, quanta innocentia debent esse imperatores? quanta deinde in
omnibus rebus temperantia? quanta fide? quanta facilitate? quanto ingenio? quanta humanitate? Quae breviter qualia sint
in Cn. Pompeio consideremus: summa enim omnia sunt, Quirites, sed ea magis ex aliorum contentione quam ipsa per sese
cognosci atque intellegi possunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quem enim imperatorem possumus ullo in numero putare, cuius in exercitu centuriatus veneant atque venierint? Quid hunc
hominem magnum aut amplum de re publica cogitare, qui pecuniam, ex aerario depromptam ad bellum administrandum, aut
propter cupiditatem provinciae magistratibus diviserit, aut propter avaritiam Romae in quaestu reliquerit? Vestra
admurmuratio facit, Quirites, ut agnoscere videamini qui haec fecerint: ego autem nomino neminem; qua re irasci mihi
nemo poterit, nisi qui ante de se voluerit confiteri. Itaque propter hanc avaritiam imperatorum quantas calamitates,
quocumque ventum est, nostri exercitus ferant quis ignorat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itinera quae per hosce annos in Italia per agros atque oppida civium Romanorum nostri imperatores fecerint recordamini:
tum facilius statuetis quid apud exteras nationes fieri existimetis. Utrum pluris arbitramini per hosce annos militum
vestrorum armis hostium urbis, an hibernis sociorum civitates esse deletas? Neque enim potest exercitum is continere
imperator, qui se ipse non continet, neque severus esse in iudicando, qui alios in se severos esse iudices non volt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hic miramur hunc hominem tantum excellere ceteris, cuius legiones sic in Asiam pervenerint, ut non modo manus tanti
exercitus, sed ne vestigium quidem cuiquam pacato nocuisse dicatur? iam vero quem ad modum milites hibernent cotidie
sermones ac litterae perferuntur: non modo ut sumptum faciat in militem nemini vis adfertur, sed ne cupienti quidem
cuiquam permittitur. Hiemis enim, non avaritiae perfugium maiores nostri in sociorum atque amicorum tectis esse
voluerunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age vero: ceteris in rebus quali sit temperantia considerate. Unde illam tantam celeritatem et tam incredibilem cursum
inventum putatis? Non enim illum eximia vis remigum aut ars inaudita quaedam gubernandi aut venti aliqui novi tam
celeriter in ultimas terras pertulerunt; sed eae res quae ceteros remorari solent, non retardarunt: non avaritia ab
instituto cursu ad praedam aliquam devocavit, non libido ad voluptatem, non amoenitas ad delectationem, non nobilitas
urbis ad cognitionem, non denique labor ipse ad quietem; postremo signa et tabulas ceteraque ornamenta Graecorum
oppidorum, quae ceteri tellenda esse arbitrantur, ea sibi ille ne visenda quidem existimavit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itaque omnes nunc in eis locis Cn. Pompeium sicut aliquem non ex hac urbe missum, sed de caelo delapsum intuentur. Nunc
denique incipiunt credere fuisse homines Romanos hac quondam continentia, quod iam nationibus exteris incredibile ac
falso memoriae proditum videbatur. Nunc imperi vestri splendor illis gentibus lucem adferre coepit. Nunc intellegunt non
sine causa maiores suos, tum cum ea temperantia magistratus habebamus, servire populo Romano quam imperare aliis
maluisse. iam vero ita faciles aditus ad eum privatorum, ita liberae querimonia de aliorum iniuriis esse dicuntur, ut
is, qui dignitate principibus excellit, facilitate infimis par esse videatur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iam quantum consilio, quantum dicendi gravitate et copia valeat,--in quo ipso inest quaedam dignitas imperatoria,--vos,
Quirites, hoc ipso ex loco saepe cognovistis. Fidem vero eius quantam inter socios existimari putatis, quam hostes omnes
omnium generum sanctissimam iudicarint? Humanitate iam tanta est, ut difficile dictu sit utrum hostes magis virtutem
eius pugnantes timuerint, an mansuetudinem victi dilexerint. Et quisquam dubitabit quin huic hoc tantum bellum
transmittendum sit, qui ad omnia nostrae memoriae bella conficienda divino quodam consilio natus esse videatur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et quoniam auctoritas quoque in bellis administrandis multum atque in imperio militari valet, certe nemini dubium est
quin ea re idem ille imperator plurimum possit. Vehementer autem pertinere ad bella administranda quid hostes, quid
socii de imperatoribus nostris existiment quis ignorat, cum sciamus homines in tantis rebus, ut aut contemnant aut
metuant aut oderint aut ament, opinione non minus et fama quam aliqua ratione certa commoveri? Quod igitur nomen umquam
in orbe terrarum clarius fuit? cuius res gestae pares? de quo homine vos,--id quod maxime facit auctoritatem,--tanta et
tam praeclara iudicia fecistis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An vero ullam usquam esse oram tam desertam putatis, quo non illius diei fama pervaserit, cum universus populus Romanus,
referto foro completisque omnibus templis ex quibus hic locus conspici potest, unum sibi ad commune omnium gentium
bellum Cn. Pompeium imperatorem deposcit? Itaque--ut plura non dicam, neque aliorum exemplis confirmem quantum [huius]
auctoritas valeat in bello--ab eodem Cn. Pompeio omnium rerum egregiarum exempla sumantur: qui quo die a vobis maritimo
bello praepositus est imperator, tanta repente vilitas annonae ex summa inopia et caritate rei frumentariae consecuta
est unius hominis spe ac nomine, quantum vix in summa ubertate agrorum diuturna pax efficere potuisset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iam accepta in Ponto calamitate ex eo proelio, de quo vos paulo ante invitus admonui,--cum socii pertimuissent, hostium
opes animique crevissent, satis firmum praesidium provincia non haberet,--amisissetis Asiam, Quirites, nisi ad ipsum
discrimen eius temporis divinitus Cn. Pompeium ad eas regiones fortuna populi Romani attulisset. Huius adventus et
Mithridatem insolita inflammatum victoria continuit, et Tigranem magnis copiis minitantem Asiae retardavit. Et quisquam
dubitabit quid virtute perfecturus sit, qui tantum auctoritate perfecerit? aut quam facile imperio atque exercitu socios
et vectigalia conservaturus sit, qui ipso nomine ac rumore defenderit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age vero, illa res quantam declarat eiusdem hominis apud hostis populi Romani autoritatem, quod ex locis tam longinquis
tamque diversis tam brevi tempore omnes huic se uni dediderunt? quod a communi Cretensium legati, cum in eorum insula
noster imperator exercitusque esset, ad Cn. Pompeium in ultimas prope terras venerunt, eique se omnis Cretensium
civitates dedere velle dixerunt? Quid? idem iste Mithridates nonne ad eundem Cn. Pompeium legatum usque in Hispaniam
misit? eum quem Pompeius legatum semper iudicavit, ei quibus erat [semper] molestum ad eum potissimum esse missum,
speculatorem quam legatum iudicari maluerunt. Potestis igitur iam constituere, Quirites, hanc auctoritatem, multis
postea rebus gestis magnisque vestris iudiciis amplificatam, quantum apud illos reges, quantum apud exteras nationes
valituram esse existimetis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliquum est ut de felicitate (quam praestare de se ipso nemo potest, meminisse et commemorare de altero possumus, sicut
aequum est homines de potestate deorum) timide et pauca dicamus. Ego enim sic existimo: Maximo, Marcello, Scipioni,
Mario, et ceteris magnis imperatoribus non solum propter virtutem, sed etiam propter fortunam saepius imperia mandata
atque exercitus esse commissos. Fuit enim profecto quibusdam summis viris quaedam ad amplitudinem et ad gloriam et ad
res magnas bene gerendas divinitus adiuncta fortuna. De huius autem hominis felicitate, de quo nunc agimus, hac utar
moderatione dicendi, non ut in illius potestate fortunam positam esse dicam, sed ut praeterita meminisse, reliqua
sperare videamur, ne aut invisa dis immortalibus oratio nostra aut ingrata esse videatur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itaque non sum praedicaturus quantas ille res domi militiae, terra marique, quantaque felicitate gesserit; ut eius
semper voluntatibus non modo cives adsenserint, socii obtemperarint, hostes obedierint, sed etiam venti tempestatesque
obsecundarint: hoc brevissime dicam, neminem umquam tam impudentem fuisse, qui ab dis immortalibus tot et tantas res
tacitus auderet optare, quot et quantas di immortales ad Cn. Pompeium detulerunt. Quod ut illi proprium ac perpetuum
sit, Quirites, cum communis solutis atque imperi tum ipsius hominis causa, sicuti facitis, velle et optare debetis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qua re,--cum et bellum sit ita necessarium ut neglegi non possit, ita magnum ut accuratissime sit administrandum; et cum
ei imperatorem praeficere possitis, in quo sit eximia belli scientia, singularis virtus, clarissima auctoritas, egregia
fortuna,--dubitatis Quirites, quin hoc tantum boni, quod vobis ab dis immortalibus oblatum et datum est, in rem publicam
conservandam atque amplificandam conferatis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quod si Romae Cn. Pompeius privatus esset hoc tempore, tamen ad tantum bellum is erat deligendus atque mittendus: nunc
cum ad ceteras summas utilitates haec quoque opportunitas adiungatur, ut in eis ipsis locis adsit, ut habeat exercitum,
ut ab eis qui habent accipere statim possit, quid exspectamus? aut cur non dicibus dis immortalibus eidem, cui cetera
summa cum salute rei publicae commissa sunt, hoc quoque bellum regium committamus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At enim vir clarissimus, amantissimus rei publicae, vestris beneficiis amplissimis adfectus, Q. Catulus, itemque summis
ornamentis honoris, fortunae, virtutis, ingeni praeditus, Q. Hortensius, ab hac ratione dissentiunt. Quorum ego
auctoritatem apud vos multis locis plurimum valuisse et valere oportere confiteor; sed in hac causa, tametsi cognoscitis
auctoritates contrarias virorum fortissimorum et clarissimorum, tamen omissis auctoritatibus ipsa re ac ratione
exquirere possumus veritatem, atque hoc facilius, quod ea omnia quae a me adhuc dicta sunt, eidem isti vera esse
concedunt,--et necessarium bellum esse et magnum, et in uno Cn. Pompeio summa esse omnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quid igitur ait Hortensius? Si uni omnia tribuenda sint, dignissimum esse Pompeium, sed ad unum tamen omnia deferri non
oportere. Obsolevit iam ista oratio, re multo magis quam verbis refutata. Nam tu idem, Q. Hortensi, multa pro tua summa
copia ac singulari facultate dicendi et in senatu contra virum fortem, A. Gabinium, graviter ornateque dixisti, cum is
de uno imperatore contra praedones constituendo legem promulgasset, et ex hoc ipso loco permuta item contra eam legem
verba fecisti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quid? tum (per deos immortalis!) si plus apud populum Romanum auctoritas tua quam ipsius populi Romani salus et vera
causa valuisset, hodie hanc gloriam atque hoc orbis terrae imperium teneremus? An tibi tum imperium hoc esse videbatur,
cum populi Romani legati quaestores praetoresque capiebantur? cum ex omnibus provinciis commeatu et privato et publico
prohibebamur? cum ita clausa nobis erant maria omnia, ut neque privatam rem transmarinam neque publicam iam obire
possemus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quae civitas antea umquam fuit,--non dico Atheniensium, quae satis late quondam mare tenuisse dicitur; non
Karthaginiensium, qui permultum classe ac maritimis rebus valuerunt; non Rhodiorum, quorum usque ad nostram memoriam
disciplina navalis et gloria remansit,--sed quae civitas umquam antea tam tenuis, quae tam parva insula fuit, quae non
portus suos et agros et aliquam partem regionis atque orae maritimae per se ipsa defenderet? At (hercule) aliquot annos
continuos ante legem Gabiniam ille populus Romanus, cuius usque ad nostram memoriam nomen invictum in navalibus pugnis
permanserit, magna ac multo maxima parte non modo utilitatis, sed dignitatis atque imperi caruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nos, quorum maiores Antiochum regem classe Persenque superarunt, omnibus navalibus pugnis Karthaginiensis, homines in
maritimis rebus exercitatissimos paratissimosque, vicerunt, ei nullo in loco iam praedonibus pares esse poteramus: nos,
qui antea non modo Italiam tutam habebamus, sed omnis socios in ultimis oris auctoritate nostri imperi salvos praestare
poteramus,--tum cum insula Delos, tam procul a nobis in Aegaeo mari posita, quo omnes undique cum mercibus atque
oneribus commeabant, referta divitiis, parva, sine muro, nihil timebat,--eidem non modo provinciis atque oris Italiae
maritimis ac portubus nostris, sed etiam Appia iam via carebamus; et eis temporibus non pudebat magistratus populi
Romani in hunc ipsum locum escendere, cum eum nobis maiores nostri exuviis nauticis et classium spoliis ornatum
reliquissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bono te animo tum, Q. Hortensi, populus Romanus et ceteros qui erant in eadem sententia, dicere existimavit ea quae
sentiebatis: sed tamen in salute communi idem populus Romanus dolori suo maluit quam auctoritati vestrae obtemperare.
Itaque una lex, unus vir, unus annus non modo nos illa miseria ac turpitudine liberavit, sed etiam effecit, ut aliquando
vere videremur omnibus gentibus ac nationibus terra marique imperare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quo mihi etiam indignius videtur obtrectatum esse adhuc,--Gabinio dicam anne Pompeio, an utrique, id quod est
verius?--ne legaretur A. Gabinius Cn. Pompeio expetenti ac postulanti. Utrum ille, qui postulat ad tantum bellum legatum
quem velit, idoneus non est qui impetret, cum ceteri ad expilandos socios diripiendasque provincias quos voluerunt
legatos eduxerint; an ipse, cuius lege salus ac dignitas populo Romano atque omnibus gentibus constituta est, expers
esse debet gloriae eius imperatoris atque eius exercitus, qui consilio ipsius ac periculo est constitutus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An C. Falcidius, Q. Metellus, Q. Caelius Latiniensis, Cn. Lentulus, quos omnis honoris causa nomino, cum tribuni plebi
fuissent, anno proximo legati ese potuerunt: in uno Gabinio sunt tam diligentes, qui in hoc bello, quod lege Gabinia
geritur, in hoc imperatore atque exercitu, quem per vos ipse constituit, etiam praecipuo iure esse deberet? De quo
legando consules spero ad senatum relaturos. Qui si dubitabunt aur gravabuntur, ego me profiteor relaturum. Neque me
impediet cuiusquam inimicum edictum, quo minus vobis fretus vestrum ius beneficiumque defendam; neque praeter
intercessionem quicquam audiam, de qua (ut arbitror) isti ipsi, qui minantur, etiam atque etiam quid liceat
considerabunt. Mea quidem sentenia, Quirites, unus A. Gabinius belli maritimi rerumque gestarum Cn. Ponpeio socius
ascribitur, propterea quod alter uni illud bellum suscipiendum vestris suffragiis detulit, alter delatum susceptumque
confecit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliquum est ut de Q. Catuli auctoritate et sententia dicendum esse videatur. Qui cum ex vobis quaereret, si in uno Cn.
Pompeio omnia poneretis, si quid eo factum esset, in quo spem essetis habituri,--cepit magnum suae virtutis fructum ac
dignitatis, cum omnes una prope voce in [eo] ipso vos spem habituros esse dixistis. Etenim talis est vir, ut nulla res
tanta sit ac tam difficilis, quam ille non et consilio regere et integritate tueri et virtute conficere possit. Sed in
hoc ipso ab eo vehementissime dissentio; quod, quo minus certa est hominum ac minus diuturna vita, hoc magis res
publica, dum per deos immortalis licet, frui debet summi viri vita atque virtute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;At enim ne quid novi fiat contra exempla atque instituta maiorum.&apos; Non dicam hoc loco maiores nostros semper in pace
consuetudini, in bello utilitati paruisse; semper ad novos casus temporum novorom consiliorum rationes adcommodasse: non
dicam duo bella maxima, Punicum atque Hispaniense, ab uno imperatore esse confecta, duasque urbis potentissimas, quae
huic imperio maxime minitabantur, Karthaginem atque Numantiam, ab eodem Scipione esse deletas: non commemorabo nuper ita
vobis patribusque vestris esse visum, ut in uno C. Mario spes imperi poneretur, ut idem cum iugurtha, idem cum Cimbris,
idem cum Teutonis bellum administraret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ipso Cn. Pompeio, in quo novi constitui nihil volt Q. Catulus, quam multa sint nova summa Q. Catuli voluntate
constituta recordamini. Quid tam novum quam adulescentulum privatum exercitum difficili rei publicae temporare
conficere? Confecit. Huic praeesse? Praefuit. Rem optime ductu suo gerere? Gessit. Quid tam praeter consuetudinem quam
homini peradulescenti, cuius aetas a senatorio gradu longe abesset, imperium atque exercitum dari, Siciliam permitti,
atque Africam bellumque in ea provincia administrandum? Fuit in his provinciis singulari innocentia, gravitate, virtute:
bellum in Africa maximum confecit, victorem exercitum deportavit. Quid vero tam inauditum quam equitem Romanum
triumphare? At eam quoque rem populus Romanus non modo vidit, sed omnium etiam studio visendam et concelebrandam
putavit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quid tam inusitatum quam ut, cum duo consules clarissimi fortissimique essent, eques Romanus ad bellum maximum
formidolosissimumque pro consule mitteretur? Missus est. Quo quidem tempore, cum esset non nemo in senatu qui diceret &apos;
non oportere mitti hominem privatum pro consule,&apos; L. Philippus dixisse dicitur non se illum sua sententia pro consule,
sed pro consulibus mittere. Tanta in eo rei publicae bene gerendae spes constituebatur, ut duorum consulum munus unius
adulescentis virtuti committeretur. Quid tam singulare quam ut ex senatus consuto legibus solutus consul ante fieret,
quam ullum alium magistratum per leges capere licuisset? quid tam incredibile quam ut iterum eques Romanus ex senatus
consulto triumpharet? Quae in omnibus hominibus nova post hominum memoriam constituta sunt, ea tam multa non sunt quam
haec, quae in hoc uno homine videmus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atque haec tot exempla, tanta ac tam nova, profecta sunt in eundem hominem a Q. Catuli atque a ceterorum eiusdem
dignitatis amplissimorum hominum auctoritate. Qua re videant ne sit periniquum et non ferundum, illorum auctoritatem de
Cn. Pompei dignitate a vobis comprobatam semper esse, vestrum ab illis de eodem homine iudicium populique Romani
auctoritatem improbari; praesertim cum iam suo iure populus Romanus in hoc homine suam auctoritatem vel contra omnis qui
dissentiunt possit defendere, propterea quod, isdem istis reclamantibus, vos unum illum ex omnibus delegistis quem bello
praedonum praeponeretis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoc si vos temere fecistis, et rei publicae parum consuluistis, recte isti studia vestra suis consiliis regere conantur.
Sin autem vos plus tum in re publica vidistis, vos eis repugnantibus per vosmet ipsos dignitatem huic imperio, salutem
orbi terrarum attulistis, aliquando isti principes et sibi et ceteris populi Romani universi auctoritati parendum esse
fateantur. Atque in hoc bello Asiatico et regio non solum militaris illa virtus, quae est in Cn. Pompeio singularis, sed
aliae quoque virtutes animi magnae et multae requiruntur. Difficile est in Asia, Cilicia, Syria regnisque interiorum
nationum ita versari nostrum imperatorem, ut nihil nisi de hoste ac de laude cogitet. Deinde etiam si qui sunt pudore ac
temperantia moderatiores, tamen eos esse talis propter multitudinem cupidiorum hominum nemo arbitratur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficile est dictu, Quirites, quanto in odio simus apud exteras nationes propter eorum, quos ad eas per hos annos cum
imperio misimus, libidines et iniurias. Quod enim fanum putatis in illis terris nostris magistratibus religiosum, quam
civitatem sanctam, quam domum satis clausam ac munitam fuisse? Urbes iam locupletes et copiosae requiruntur, quibus
causa belli propter diripiendi cupiditatem inferatur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libenter haec coram cum Q. Catulo et Q. Hortensio, summis et clarissimis viris, disputarem. Noverunt enim sociorum
volnera, vident eorum calamitates, querimonias audiunt. Pro sociis vos contra hostis exercitum mittere putatis, an
hostium simulatione contra socios atque amicos? Quae civitas est in Asia quae non modo imperatoris aut legati, sed unius
tribuni militum animos ac spiritus capere possit? Qua re, etiam si quem habetis qui conlatis signis exercitus regios
superare posse videatur, tamen nisi erit idem, qui se a pecuniis sociorum, qui ab eorum coniugibus ac liberis, qui ab
ornamentis fanorum atque oppidorum, qui ab auro gazaque regia manus, oculos, animum cohibere possit, non erit idoneus
qui ad bellum Asiaticum regiumque mittatur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecquam putatis civitatem pacatam fuisse quae locuples sit? ecquam esse locupletem quae istis pacata esse videatur? Ora
maritima, Quirites, Cn. Pompeium non solum propter rei militaris gloriam, sed etiam propter animi continentiam
requisivit. Videbat enim praetores locupletari quot annis pecunia publica praeter paucos; neque eos quicquam aliud
adsequi, classium nomine, nisi ut detrimentis accipiendis maiore adfici turpitudine videremur. Nunc qua cupiditate
homines in provincias, quibus iacturis et quibus condicionibus proficiscantur, ignorant videlicet isti, qui ad unum
deferenda omnia esse non arbitrantur? Quasi vero Cn. Pompeium non cum suis virtutibus tum etiam alienis vitiis magnum
esse videamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qua re nolite dubitare quin huic uni credatis omnia, qui inter tot annos unus inventus sit, quem socii in urbis suas cum
exercitu venisse gaudeant. Quod si auctoritatibus hanc causam, Quirites, confirmandam putatis, est vobis auctor vir
bellorum omnium maximarumque rerum peritissimus, P. Servilius, cuius tantae res gestae terra marique exstiterunt, ut cum
de bello deliberetis, auctor vobis gravior nemo esse debeat; est C. Curio, summis vestris beneficiis maximisque rebus
gestis, summo ingenio et prudentia praeditus; est Cn. Lentulus, in quo omnes pro amplissimis vestris honoribus summum
consilium, summam gravitatem esse cognovistis; est C. Cassius, integritate, virtute, constantia singulari. Que re videte
ut horum auctoritatibus illorum orationi qui dissentiunt, respondere posse videamur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Que cum ita sint, C. Manlili, primum istam tuam et legem et voluntatem et sententiam laudo vehementissimeque comprobo:
deinde te hortor, ut auctore populo Romano maneas in sententia, neve cuiusquam vim aut minas pertimescas. Primum in te
satis esse animi perseverantiaeque arbitror: deinde cum tantam multitudinem cum tanto studio adesse videamus, quantam
iterum nunc in eodem homine praeficiendo videmus, quid est quod aut de re aut de perficiendi facultate dubitemus? Ego
autem quicquid est in me studi, consili, laboris, ingeni, quicquid hoc beneficio populi Romani atque hac potestate
praetoria, quicquid auctoritate, fide, constantia possum, id omne ad hanc re conficiendam tibi et populo Romano
polliceor ac defero:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testorque omnis deos, et eos maxime qui huic loco temploque praesident, qui omnium mentis eorum qui ad rem publicam
adeunt maxime perspiciunt, me hoc neque rogatu facere cuiusquam, neque quo Cn. Pompei gratiam mihi per hanc causam
conciliari putem, neque quo mihi ex cuiusquam amplitudine aut praesidia periculis aut adiumenta honoribus quaeram;
propterea quod pericula facile, ut hominem praestare oportet, innocentia tecti repellemus, honorem autem neque ab uno
neque ex hoc loco, sed eadem illa nostra laboriosissima ratione vitae, si vestra voluntas feret, consequemur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quam ob rem quicquid in hac causa mihi susceptum est, Quirites, id ego omne me rei publicae causa suscepisse confirmo;
tantumque abest ut aliquam mihi bonam gratiam quaesisse videar, ut multas me etiam simultates partim obscuras, partim
apertas intellegam mihi non necessarias, vobis non inutilis suscepisse. Sed ego me hoc honore praeditum, tantis vestris
beneficiis adfectum statui, Quirites, vestram voluntatem et rei publicae dignitatem et salutem provinciarum atque
sociorum meis omnibus commodis et rationibus praeferre oportere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Video Transcript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his
actions on September 8, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that day, a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect
a group of government officials, a group of Afghan government officials, who would be meeting with some local village
elders. The column came under ambush, and was surrounded on three sides, and amongst many other things, Captain Swenson
was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead. One of the people he rescued was
a sergeant, and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what was remarkable about this day is, by sheer coincidence, one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro
camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera. It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this
wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck. They put him in the helicopter, and then you see Captain Swenson
bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this, and I thought to myself, where do people like that come from? What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,
when you would want to do that. There&apos;s a love there, and I wanted to know why is it that I don&apos;t have people that I
work with like that? You know, in the military, they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so
that others may gain. In business, we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain. We
have it backwards. Right? So I asked myself, where do people like this come from? And my initial conclusion was that
they&apos;re just better people. That&apos;s why they&apos;re attracted to the military. These better people are attracted to this
concept of service. But that&apos;s completely wrong. What I learned was that it&apos;s the environment, and if you get the
environment right, every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things, and more importantly, others
have that capacity too. I&apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these, who we would call heroes, who have
put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others, and I asked them, &quot;Why would you do it? Why did you do it?&quot;
And they all say the same thing: &quot;Because they would have done it for me.&quot; It&apos;s this deep sense of trust and
cooperation. So trust and cooperation are really important here. The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is
that they are feelings, they are not instructions. I can&apos;t simply say to you, &quot;Trust me,&quot; and you will. I can&apos;t simply
instruct two people to cooperate, and they will. It&apos;s not how it works. It&apos;s a feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does that feeling come from? If you go back 50,000 years to the Paleolithic era, to the early days of Homo
sapiens, what we find is that the world was filled with danger, all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.
Nothing personal. Whether it was the weather, lack of resources, maybe a saber-toothed tiger, all of these things
working to reduce our lifespan. And so we evolved into social animals, where we lived together and worked together in
what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe, where we felt like we belonged. And when we felt safe amongst our own,
the natural reaction was trust and cooperation. There are inherent benefits to this. It means I can fall asleep at night
and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger. If we don&apos;t trust each other, if I don&apos;t trust you,
that means you won&apos;t watch for danger. Bad system of survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern day is exactly the same thing. The world is filled with danger, things that are trying to frustrate our lives
or reduce our success, reduce our opportunity for success. It could be the ups and downs in the economy, the uncertainty
of the stock market. It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight. Or it could be
your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you. It&apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business, but at the very
minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you. We have no control over these forces.
These are a constant, and they&apos;re not going away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only variable are the conditions inside the organization, and that&apos;s where leadership matters, because it&apos;s the
leader that sets the tone. When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the
organization first, to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results, so that the people remain and feel
safe and feel like they belong, remarkable things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was flying on a trip, and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number
was called, and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law, like a criminal. He was yelled
at for attempting to board one group too soon. So I said something. I said, &quot;Why do you have to treat us like cattle?
Why can&apos;t you treat us like human beings?&quot; And this is exactly what she said to me. She said, &quot;Sir, if I don&apos;t follow
the rules, I could get in trouble or lose my job.&quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn&apos;t feel safe. All she was
telling me is that she doesn&apos;t trust her leaders. The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they
necessarily hire better people. It&apos;s because they don&apos;t fear their leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, if the conditions are wrong, we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each
other, and that inherently weakens the organization. When we feel safe inside the organization, we will naturally
combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is, is like being a parent. If you think about what being a great
parent is, what do you want? What makes a great parent? We want to give our child opportunities, education, discipline
them when necessary, all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves. Great leaders want
exactly the same thing. They want to provide their people opportunity, education, discipline when necessary, build their
self-confidence, give them the opportunity to try and fail, all so that they could achieve more than we could ever
imagine for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Kim, who&apos;s the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City, a tech company, he makes the point that if
you had hard times in your family, would you ever consider laying off one of your children? We would never do it. Then
why do we consider laying off people inside our organization? Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment. If
you get a job at Next Jump, you cannot get fired for performance issues. In fact, if you have issues, they will coach
you and they will give you support, just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from
school. It&apos;s the complete opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred, anger, at some of these banking CEOs with their
disproportionate salaries and bonus structures. It&apos;s not the numbers. It&apos;s that they have violated the very definition
of leadership. They have violated this deep-seated social contract. We know that they allowed their people to be
sacrificed so they could protect their own interests, or worse, they sacrificed their people to protect their own
interests. This is what so offends us, not the numbers. Would anybody be offended if we gave a $150 million bonus to
Gandhi? How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa? Do we have an issue with that? None at all. None at all. Great
leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers. They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Chapman, who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called Barry-Wehmiller, in 2008 was hit very hard by
the recession, and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight. Now in a large manufacturing company, this is a big
deal, and they could no longer afford their labor pool. They needed to save 10 million dollars, so, like so many
companies today, the board got together and discussed layoffs. And Bob refused. You see, Bob doesn&apos;t believe in head
counts. Bob believes in heart counts, and it&apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count. And so they came up
with a furlough program. Every employee, from secretary to CEO, was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation. They
could take it any time they wanted, and they did not have to take it consecutively. But it was how Bob announced the
program that mattered so much. He said, it&apos;s better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to
suffer a lot, and morale went up. They saved 20 million dollars, and most importantly, as would be expected, when the
people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization, the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate.
And quite spontaneously, nobody expected, people started trading with each other. Those who could afford it more would
trade with those who could afford it less. People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank. I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are
absolutely not leaders. They are authorities, and we do what they say because they have authority over us, but we would
not follow them. And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are
absolutely leaders, and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them, and they have
chosen to look after the person to the right of them. This is what a leader is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater, and as is the Marine custom, the officer ate last, and he let
his men eat first, and when they were done, there was no food left for him. And when they went back out in the field,
his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat, because that&apos;s what happens. We call them leaders because
they go first. We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does. We call them leaders because
they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain, and when we
do, the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us. They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to
see that their leader&apos;s vision comes to life, and when we ask them, &quot;Why would you do that? Why would you give your
blood and sweat and tears for that person?&quot; they all say the same thing: &quot;Because they would have done it for me.&quot; And
isn&apos;t that the organization we would all like to work in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you. (Applause)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you. (Applause)&lt;/p&gt;

이런 장면과 이런 말이 있다.&lt;/p&gt;

무죄 판결이 나서 전과조회는 되지 않지만,
정당방위로 사람을 죽인 적이 있는

&lt;p&gt;그리고 이런 말, 대화가 나온다.

안 잡히게 해 놨는데, 왜 그걸 들춰냅니까
내가 내 과거를 잊고 싶듯 다른 사람의 과거도
잊어주고 덮어주는 게 인간 아닙니까.&apos;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;여기 회사야!!!&apos;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;회사는 기계가 다니는 뎁니까? 인간이 다니는 뎁니다!&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;살다 보면 참 잊기 쉬운 말이다. &apos;인간&apos;. 신기하게 인간이 살고 있는 세상이고 인간을 위해 쌓아 올린 세상인데 인간이 없다. 아니, 정확하게는
인간성이 없다. 도로 위에 수많은 난폭, 폭력 운전자들. 직장, 일이라는 이유로 인간다움을 마음 한편에 접어두라는 사람들. 돈 없고 힘없으면
무시당해도 되고 서러워도 아무도 신경 쓰지 않는 사람들. 다수가 불편하면 외면당해도 되는 소수들. 어리고 학생이면 선택할 수 없고 저항하면
안 되는.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;아무런 의욕도 없이 억지로 살아가는 중년 남자와 태어날 때부터 불행한 운명을 짊어지고 살아온 젊은 여자의 이야기가 이를 본 많은 이들에게
어떻게 &apos;인생의 드라마&apos;가 되었는지 궁금할 것입니다. 놀랍게도 그랬습니다. 박동훈과 이지안은 서로를 인간 대 인간으로 완전히 이해했고,
서로에게 큰 위로가 되었습니다. 이지안을 돕는 과정을 통해 박동훈 역시 자신의 내면에서 다른 것을 발견하고, 자신을 더 사랑하는 것에서
벗어나 더 적극적으로 살아갈 수 있었고, 이지안은 다른 사람들과 달리 자신에게 &apos;4배 이상&apos; 잘해주는 박동훈 같은 사람을 만난 이후 &apos;처음
살아보는 삶&apos;을 살게 되었습니다. 이 둘이 어둠 속에서 서로에게 빛이 되고 마침내 터널을 벗어나면, 시청자들은 이 힘들고 외로운 삶 속에서
희망을 볼 수 있는 것처럼 경험합니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;우울한 사람들을 보지만, 어쩐지 희망적인 느낌을 줍니다. 슬픈 사람들을 보지만, 어쩐지 미소를 짓게 만듭니다. 배경에는 추운 겨울날이지만,
여러분의 마음은 한없이 따뜻해질 것입니다. 사회적으로 소외되고 외로운 사람들이 모여서 이야기하는 것 같습니다. &quot;괜찮아요. 이 세상은 여전히
살 가치가 있어요.&quot; 무엇보다도, 여러분의 삶에서 진정한 사람들을 만나거나, 그들 중 한 명이 되고 싶다는 생각을 하게 만듭니다. 어떤 판단도
없이 힘든 시기를 겪고 있는 그 사람을 볼 때, 여러분은 그 사람의 편이 될 수 있는 사람으로 성장하고 싶습니다. 더 중요한 것은, 그런
방식으로, 여러분은 인간이 할 수 있는 최고의 가치를 실천하는 것이 여러분의 삶에서 더 많은 의미를 찾을 수 있기 때문에 더 많은 것을 얻을
수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;어떻게 보면 인생은 외적인 힘과 내적인 힘의 싸움이고, 어떤 일이 있어도 내적인 힘이 있으면 견딜 수 있습니다. (박동훈)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;리더십은 무한한 게임이다&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;많은 리더, 심지어 가장 좋은 의도를 가진 리더들조차도 종종 &quot;어떻게 하면 직원들로부터 최대한의 성과를 이끌어낼 수 있을까?&quot;라고 묻습니다. 그러나 이것은 잘못된 질문입니다. 직원들이 더 강해지도록 돕는 방법에 대한 질문이 아니라 직원들로부터 더 많은 성과를 끌어내는 것에 대한 질문입니다. 직원들은 짜낼 젖은 수건과 같지 않습니다. 직원들은 우리가 마지막 한 방울의 성과까지 짜낼 수 있는 대상이 아닙니다. 이러한 질문에 대한 답은 일시적으로 더 많은 성과를 낼 수 있지만, 장기적으로는 직원들과 문화에 비용을 초래합니다. 이러한 접근 방식은 결코 사랑과 헌신의 감정을 불러일으키지 못할 것입니다.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.qubitpi.org/posts/humanistic-psychology/#chapter-3---the-16-propositions-about-motivation&quot;&gt;더 나은 질문은 &quot;직원들이 자연스럽게 최선을 다해 일할 수 있는 환경을 어떻게 만들 수 있을까?&quot;입니다.&lt;/a&gt; (제안 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;일을 하는 사람이 아니라, 일을 하는 사람들을 이끄는 사람이 더 큰 변화를 만들어낼 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;자원보다 국민의 의지가 우선&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;어떤 게임에서든 플레이하는 데는 항상 두 가지 통화가 필요합니다. 의지와 자원입니다. 자원은 구체적이고 쉽게 측정할 수 있습니다. 자원에 대해 이야기할 때, 우리는 보통 돈에 대해 이야기합니다. 그리고 조직의 선호도나 당시의 기준에 따라, 이러한 자원은 수익, 이익, EBITDA, EPS, 현금 흐름, 벤처 캐피털, 사모펀드, 주가 등 여러 가지 방법으로 계산할 수 있습니다. 자원은 일반적으로 고객이나 투자자와 같은 외부 소스에서 나오며 조직의 건강에 기여하는 모든 재무 지표의 합계를 나타냅니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;반면에 의지는 무형이고 측정하기 어렵습니다. 의지에 대해 이야기할 때, 우리는 사람들이 직장에 올 때 느끼는 감정에 대해 이야기합니다. 의지는 사기, 동기 부여, 영감, 헌신, 참여 의지, 재량적 노력을 제공하려는 의지 등을 포함합니다. 의지는 일반적으로 리더십의 질과 정당한 대의의 명확성과 힘과 같은 내부 소스에서 나옵니다. 의지는 조직의 건강에 기여하는 모든 인간적 요소의 합계를 나타냅니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;우리 대부분은 회의에 앉아 리더가 우선순위를 발표하는 것을 들었을 것입니다... 그리고 그것은 종종 다음과 같습니다: 1. 성장. 2. 고객. 3. 직원. 그 리더는 직원을 소중히 여긴다고 주장할 것입니다(&quot;직원&quot;은 우선순위 중 하나입니다). 하지만 목록에 나열된 순서가 중요합니다. 이 경우 직원보다 더 중요한 것으로 여겨지는 것이 적어도 두 가지가 있으며, 그 중 하나가 리소스입니다. 리더가 우선순위를 나열하는 방식은 그들의 편견을 드러냅니다. 그리고 그들의 편견은 그들이 내리는 선택에 영향을 미칠 것입니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;유한한 사고방식의 리더는 점수에 대한 편향을 보이는 경향이 있습니다. 그 결과, 그들은 종종 &quot;유감스럽게도&quot; 사람들에게 비용이 들더라도 짧은 시간 내에 결과를 보여주는 선택을 선택합니다. 예를 들어, 이들은 어려운 시기에 동일한 즉각적인 결과를 보여주지 않을 수 있는 대안을 모색하기보다는 먼저 해고와 극단적인 비용 절감 조치를 취할 리더입니다. 비록 장기적인 이점이 있더라도 말입니다. 리더가 자원에 대한 편향이 있다면, 다음 주에 인력의 10%를 감축함으로써 즉각적인 절감을 계산하는 것이 대차대조표에 반영되기까지 더 오랜 시간이 걸리는 옵션을 선택하는 것보다 훨씬 쉽습니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;반면에 무한한 사고방식의 리더들은 오늘날의 재정적 압박을 넘어 사람을 이윤보다 우선시하기 위해 열심히 노력합니다. 힘든 시기에는 사람을 삭감해야 할 또 다른 비용으로 보는 경향이 적고, 결과가 실현되기까지 시간이 더 걸릴 수 있더라도 돈을 절약할 수 있는 다른 방법을 모색할 의향이 더 큽니다. 힘든 시기를 넘어 생각하면, 무한한 사고방식을 가진 리더는 국민의 의지를 지키기 위해 저축이 축적될 때까지 분기나 1년 또는 그 이상을 기다려도 괜찮습니다. 그들은 국민의 의지가 재량적 노력과 문제 해결, 상상력, 팀워크를 이끄는 원동력이라는 것을 이해합니다. 이 모든 것이 미래에 생존하고 번영하는 데 필수적입니다. 자원보다 강한 의지의 가치를 과소평가할 수 없습니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important[의지가 강할 때]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;매우 자주, 유한한 사고방식의 리더들은 의지의 원천이 급여 패키지, 보너스, 특전 또는 내부 경쟁과 같은 외부적 동기에 있다고 믿습니다. 그것이 인간에게 영감을 주는 데 필요한 전부라면 좋겠습니다. 돈은 많은 것을 살 수 있습니다. 사실, 우리는 돈으로 사람들에게 동기를 부여할 수 있습니다. 열심히 일하도록 돈을 지불할 수 있습니다. 하지만 돈으로 진정한 의지를 살 수는 없습니다. 사람들이 최선을 다하도록 외부적으로 보상받는 조직과 사람들이 그렇게 하도록 내재적으로 동기를 부여받는 조직의 차이는 용병으로 가득 찬 조직과 광신도로 가득 찬 조직의 차이입니다. 용병은 우리가 그들의 노력에 대해 최고 가격을 지불하는 한 열심히 일합니다. 회사나 팀에 대한 충성심이 거의 없습니다. 누군가가 자신보다 더 큰 무언가에 기여하고 있다는 진정한 소속감이나 느낌이 없습니다. 용병은 사랑과 헌신으로 희생할 가능성이 없습니다. 반면에 광신도는 조직의 일원이 되는 것을 좋아합니다. 그들이 하는 일로 부자가 될 수는 있지만, 부자가 되기 위해 하는 것은 아닙니다. 그들은 정의로운 대의를 믿기 때문에 그렇게 합니다.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6x7TXcypn3I&quot; title=&quot;평생 이 회사가 잘 되길 바랄 겁니다&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;강한 의지는 하룻밤 사이에 만들어질 수 없으며, 아무것도 없는 상태에서 얻어지는 것도 아닙니다. 의지는 회사 문화에 의해 생성됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHlFSHPJrQU&quot; title=&quot;Oliver Twist (2005)&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Twist#Major_themes_and_symbols&quot;&gt;Major Themes and Symbols&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Oliver Twist, Dickens mixes grim realism with merciless satire to describe the effects of industrialism on
19th-century England and to criticise the harsh new Poor Laws. &lt;strong&gt;Oliver&lt;/strong&gt;, an innocent child, is trapped in a world
where his only options seem to be the workhouse, a life of crime symbolised by Fagin&apos;s gang, a prison, or an early
grave. From this unpromising industrial/institutional setting, however, a fairy tale also emerges. In the midst of
corruption and degradation, the essentially passive Oliver &lt;em&gt;remains pure-hearted; he steers away from evil when those
around him give in to it&lt;/em&gt;, and in proper fairy-tale fashion, he eventually receives his reward - leaving for a peaceful
life in the country, surrounded by kind friends. On the way to this happy ending, Dickens explores the kind of life an
outcast, orphan boy could expect to lead in 1830s London&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nancy&lt;/strong&gt;, by contrast, redeems herself at the cost of her own life and dies in a prayerful pose. She is one of the few
characters in Oliver Twist to display much ambivalence. Her storyline in the novel strongly reflects themes of domestic
violence and psychological abuse at the hands of Bill. Although Nancy is a full-fledged criminal, indoctrinated and
trained by Fagin since childhood, she retains enough empathy to repent her role in Oliver&apos;s kidnapping, and to take
steps to try to atone. As one of Fagin&apos;s victims, corrupted but not yet morally dead, she gives eloquent voice to the
horrors of the old man&apos;s little criminal empire. She wants to save Oliver from a similar fate; at the same time, she
recoils from the idea of turning traitor, especially to Bill Sikes, whom she loves. When Dickens was later criticised
for giving to a &quot;thieving, whoring slut of the streets&quot; such an unaccountable reversal of character, he ascribed her
change of heart to &quot;the last fair drop of water at the bottom of a dried-up, weed-choked well&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leadership is, at root, about Influencing Others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the movie symbolizes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule&quot;&gt;Golden Rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with the huge pressure of meeting deadlines or attaining shareholder profitability targets, in most cases,
the Golden Rule tends to be forgotten by employers. In this respect, business leaders need to stop putting corporate
priorities and greed above the needs of employees. I am not arguing for an end of profit, but to prevent businesses from
profiting from employee harm and potential exploitation. Profits should be a product of an organisation’s purpose, but
not the purpose of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

No</title><link>https://ai.qubitpi.org/posts/managing-tech-assets-common-lib-or-not/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ai.qubitpi.org/posts/managing-tech-assets-common-lib-or-not/</guid><description>Managing Tech Assets - Is a Common Library a Good Idea? No</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;A Story - A Person Created a Common Library and Then...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Embarrassingly I introduced a &quot;common&quot; library, named as such, in a team environment a couple of decades back.
I didn&apos;t really understand the dynamics back then of what could happen in a loosely-coordinated team setting in just a
matter of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I introduced it I thought I made it clear and also documented that it&apos;s for things we&apos;d all agree we find useful on
a daily basis, that it&apos;s intended to be a minimalist library, and that the library should depend on nothing else besides
the standard library so that it&apos;s as easy to deploy as possible in new projects. My thinking at the time was that it was
our own little extension to the standard library for things that, in our particular domain, we found useful on a daily
basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it started off well enough. We started off with a math library (&lt;code&gt;common/math*&lt;/code&gt;) of routines which we all used on a
daily basis, since we were working on computer graphics which was often heavy on the linear algebra. And since we were
often interoping with C code, we agreed on some useful utility functions like find_index which, unlike std::find in C++,
would return an index to an element found in a sequence instead of an iterator which mimicked how our C functions worked
-- things of this sort -- a little bit eclectic but minimalist and widely used enough to remain familiar and practical
to everyone, and instant familiarity is an extremely important criteria as I see it in trying to make anything that is
&quot;common&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; since if it truly is &quot;common&quot;, it should have that familiar quality about it as a result of its
wide adoption and daily usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over time the design intentions of the library slipped out of my fingers as people started to add things they used
personally that they merely thought might be of use to someone else, only to find no one else using it. And later
someone started adding functions that depended on OpenGL for common GL-related routines. Further on we adopted Qt and
people started adding code that depended on Qt, so already the common library was dependent on two external libraries.
At some point someone added common shader routines which was dependent on our application-specific shader library, and
at that point you couldn&apos;t even deploy it in a new project without bringing in Qt, OGL, and our application-specific
shader library and writing a non-trivial build script for your project. So it turned into this eclectic, interdependent
mess. Later on people even added GUI-dependent code to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&apos;ve also found by debating what should and shouldn&apos;t go into this library that what is considered &quot;common&quot; can
easily turn into a very subjective idea if you don&apos;t set a very hard line rule that what&apos;s &quot;common&quot; is what everyone
tends to find useful on a daily basis. Any loosening of the standards and it quickly degrades from things everyone finds
useful on a daily basis to something a single developer finds useful that might have the possibility of being beneficial
to someone else, and at that point the library degrades into an eclectic mess really fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But furthermore when you reach that point, some developers can start adding things for the simple reason that they don&apos;t
like the programming language. They might not like the syntax of a for loop or a function call, at which point the
library is starting to get filled with things that&apos;s just fighting the fundamental syntax of the language, replacing a
couple of lines of straightforward code which isn&apos;t really duplicating any logic down to a single terse line of exotic
code only familiar to the developer who introduced such a shorthand. Then such a developer might start adding more
functionality to the common library implemented using such shorthands, at which point significant sections of the common
library become interwoven with these exotic shorthands which might seem beautiful and intuitive to the developer who
introduced it but ugly and foreign and hard to understand for everyone else. And at that point I think you know that any
hope of making something truly &quot;common&quot; is lost, since &quot;common&quot; and &quot;unfamiliar&quot; are polar opposite ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&apos;s all kinds of cans of worms there, at least in a loosely-coordinated team environment, with a library with
ambitions as broad and as generalized as just &quot;commonly-used stuff&quot;. And while the underlying problem might have been
the loose coordination above all else, at least multiple libraries intended to serve a more singular purpose, like a
library intended to provide math routines and nothing else, probably wouldn&apos;t degrade as significantly in terms of its
design purity and dependencies as a &quot;common&quot; library. So in retrospect I think it would be much better to err on the
side of libraries which have much more clear design intentions. I&apos;ve also found over the years that narrow in purpose
and narrow in applicability are radically different ideas. Often the most widely applicable things are the narrowest and
most singular in purpose, since you can then say, &quot;aha, this is exactly what I need&quot;, as opposed to wading through an
eclectic library of disparate functionality trying to see if it has something you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I&apos;m admittedly at least a little bit impractical and care maybe a bit too much about aesthetics, but the way I tend
to perceive my idea of a library&apos;s quality (and maybe even &quot;beauty&quot;) is judged more by its weakest link than its
strongest, in a similar way that if you presented me the most appetitizing food in the world but, on the same plate, put
something rotting on there that smells really bad, I tend to want to reject the entire plate. And if you&apos;re like me in
that regard and make something that invites all sorts of additions as something called &quot;common&quot;, you might find yourself
looking at that analogical plate with something rotting on the side. So likewise I think it&apos;s good if a library is
organized and named and documented in a way such that it doesn&apos;t invite more and more and more additions over time. And
that can even apply to your personal creations, since I&apos;ve certainly created some rotten stuff here and there, and it
&quot;taints&quot; a lot less if it&apos;s not being added to the biggest plate. Separating things out into small, very singular
libraries has a tendency to better decouple code as well, if only by the sheer virtue that it becomes far less
convenient to start coupling everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip
Code deduplication has been hammered into me over the years but I feel like I should try it this time around.
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I might suggest in your case is to start to take it easy on code deduplication. I&apos;m not saying to copy and paste
big snippets of poorly-tested, error-prone code around or anything of this sort, or duplicating huge amounts of
non-trivial code that has a decent probability of requiring changes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But especially if you are of the mindset to create a &quot;common&quot; library, for which I assume your desire is to create
something widely-applicable, highly reusable, and perhaps ideally something you find just as useful today as you do a
decade from now, then sometimes you might even need or want some duplication to achieve this elusive quality. Because
the duplication might actually serve as a decoupling mechanism. It&apos;s like if you want to separate a video player from an
MP3 player, then you at least have to duplicate some things like batteries and hard drives. They can&apos;t share these
things or else they&apos;re indivisibly coupled and cannot be used independently of each other, and at that point people
might not be interested in the device anymore if all they want to do is play MP3s. But some time after you split these
two devices apart, you might find that the MP3 player can benefit from a different battery design or smaller hard drive
than the video player, at which point you&apos;re no longer duplicating anything; what initially started out as duplication
to allow this interdependent device to split into two separate, independent devices might later turn out to yield
designs and implementations that are no longer redundant at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s worth considering things from the perspective of the one using a library. Would you actually want to use a library
that minimizes code duplication? Chances are that you won&apos;t because one that does will naturally depend on other
libraries. And those other libraries might depend on other libraries to avoid duplicating their code, and so on, until
you might need to import/link 50 different libraries to just to get some basic functionality like loading and playing an
audio file, and that becomes very unwieldy. Meanwhile if such an audio library deliberately chose to duplicate some
things here and there to achieve its independence, it becomes so much easier to use in new projects, and chances are
that it won&apos;t need to be updated nearly as often since it won&apos;t need to change as a result of one its dependent external
libraries changing which might be trying to fulfill a much more generalized purpose than what the audio library needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sometimes it&apos;s worth deliberately choosing to duplicate a little bit (consciously, never out of laziness -- actually
out of diligence) in order to decouple a library and make it independent because, through that independence, it achieves
a wider range of practical applicability and even stability (no more afferent couplings). If you want to design the most
reusable libraries possible that will last you from one project to the next and over the years, then on top of narrowing
its scope to the minimum, I would actually suggest considering duplicating a little bit here. And naturally write unit
tests and make sure it&apos;s really thoroughly tested and reliable at what it&apos;s doing. This is only for the libraries that
you really want to take the time to generalize to a point that goes far beyond a single project.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last
7 years or so of my tech career, it&apos;s enabled me to have a lot of fun studying and applying rigorous principles of
software design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know why classes should be small, while most people are frustrated by giant class design piled up with hundreds
of lines of code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know why we should write tests before a single line of production code is written?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know why the root cause of a failed software is always a tiny deviation of a code standard that is often easily
ignored by everybody?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this book, you&apos;ll know the answers to these and many other questions that have implications for your
professional life and for the way you look at Software Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal, by the end of this book, is to help you fundamentally rethink what makes a good software. I hope to lead you
there by presenting a wide range of proven practices that are in many cases quite powerful. Once you see how systematic
approaches are applied in implementing software, I think you will begin to learn how to avoid common pitfalls in this
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I tell you about those practical and useful industry standards on many aspects of Software Engineering, I
feel it is important that I tell you about the origins of my somewhat over-stricted view and therefore of this book.
Luckily, my introduction to this arena started with one of my Yahoo! colleague, Rick, who profoundly changed my outlook
on Software Development and largely determined my future philosophy on Software Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cdeszaq&quot;&gt;Rick&lt;/a&gt; was a Senior Software Engineer at Yahoo!. During my very early career period,
however, I was at that time a recent graduate who just learned there was something called &quot;code review&quot; in this world
few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fascinating persona Rick presented about himself, what struck me most about him was his attitude to
each details of the Software design and implementation. Many times, when I raised a question in front of him in office,
he always replied with what I believed during that time extremely insightful answers. I was always happy to stand on his
side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But coming up with such thought match was not easy in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On what would otherwise have been a normal weekday afternoon in the life of an 24-year-old Jiaqi, a little Slack message
started to worry him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jiaqi, I just reviewed your
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;.
Looks much better. I left some new comments for you to look at. Let me know if you have any questions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &quot;(No way, Rick &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16126939/177282165-99a4ff14-7ca1-4a43-a806-4a7b6b600fa4.gif&quot; alt=&quot;35&quot; /&gt; Again??? You gotta be kidding me o_O)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent Rick a thank-you note via Slack and, then, jumped into that PR. No surprise, &lt;strong&gt;30+&lt;/strong&gt; code review comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Missing a period at the end of sentence&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;This line break is not necessary&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;The Javadoc of this class is a bit ambiguous; you don&apos;t want to lose all details when you read your code again in 6
months&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;By design, this object should not be passed to the next business layer&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was probably the 20th round of code review on a single PR (how many times did you ever get involved in a PR where
people rejected your PR 20+ times?). It&apos;s not a bad PR to be honest with you. Regular feature change in about 500 lines
of code. I think I did a good job on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris: &quot;How&apos;s everything going, Jiaqi? Work done already?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &quot;Well... almost, except Rick just shot me another 30 comments. It&apos;ll probably take 2 hours&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris: &quot;😊 Don&apos;t worry&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris was my boss and he managed our team. He knew I was kinda green and needed more time to ramp up. But another 30
comments on 20th review is probably a little bit of shock to him. I wish I could tell Chris &quot;I promise the code works
now already. I&apos;m just trying to make Rick happy. You know, he is a perfectionism...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to end this little miserable infinity in the next code review, I continued to working on Rick&apos;s comment until I
noticed one of his comments. It was more of like a &quot;little-design-change &amp;amp; code-style&quot; comment which didn&apos;t seem to
change any code logic. But as I implement his proposed change, I spotted a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat back and thought about it for a while...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, this was simply a design change which doesn&apos;t imply any change of logic, let alone a bug fix. But Rick&apos;s better
design literally avoided a potentially serious bug that could annoy users in production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is amazing!&quot;. It&apos;s like getting a job promotion simply by improving your daily dress code. A change of attitude
towards code design can make your code 100 times better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, I changed my view on Rick&apos;s code review and I started to learn from his thoughts. When everyone was
reluctant to ask for his review, I grabbed every chance and ask him to do that for me every day. He was also happy to
teach me with those &quot;endless&quot; code review comments, but this did not diminish my enthusiasm. I was always able to learn
something from his review comments. At the end of the day, &lt;strong&gt;I learned, from Rick, that Software Engineering is not
about &quot;making it work&quot;. It&apos;s about &quot;making it right&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. To make it right, I have to make it perfect and it is only
through this way I am approving to myself that I love what I am doing. When I love it, I will make it good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new understanding - that Software Engineering is a branch of science that requires rigorous thinking to justify its
applicability - lured me into the study of code review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Rick who told me how perfectionism can shape your view and action in SWE and, also, the reason I put together
this post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Marshall Started to Think Differently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts with author&apos;s childhood, a summer of 1943 at Detroit. A severe race-war was going on at that time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YP9cbo5CkU&amp;amp;list=PL-CLnI8tPXu_RDkYU9BOeuzFqrEL8dQ1l&amp;amp;index=9&quot;&gt;1943 Riots (YouTube)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8BrJmF-jv4&amp;amp;list=PL-CLnI8tPXu_RDkYU9BOeuzFqrEL8dQ1l&amp;amp;index=10&quot;&gt;Detroit 1943 Race Riot Footage in HD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/race-riot-1943&quot;&gt;Race Riot of 1943 (Encyclopedia Of Detroit)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under that terrible circumstance, the author was humiliated by 2 white boys in school. After that experience Marshall
(the author) started thinking about 2 questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens to disconnect us from our compassionate nature, leading us to behave violently and exploitatively?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What allows some people to stay connected to their compassionate nature under even the most trying circumstances?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were treated horribly, I would almost have never had that though process. So what&apos;s unique about Marshall that
triggered his life-long research? I did some research by looking for Marshall&apos;s biography. I also noticed that Marshall
was also a Jews, according to the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Quote]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had never heard the word before and didn&apos;t know some people used it in a derogatory way to refer to Jews.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that Jews people had some hard time surviving themselves in the course of our history, I thought a deep longing
for peace might be the biggest desire in the bottom of each Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I settled down to his relation to Judaism and found this part of a wikipedia article on &quot;Judaism and peace&quot; shall be
the answer to the question above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Judaism and peace from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_peace#Rejection_of_violence&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rejection of violence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judaism&apos;s religious texts overwhelmingly endorse compassion and peace, and the Hebrew Bible contains the well-known
commandment to &quot;love thy neighbor as thyself&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the love of peace and the pursuit of peace is one of the key principles in Jewish law. While Jewish tradition
permits waging war and killing in certain cases, however, the requirement is that one always seek a just peace before
waging war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the 1947 Columbus Platform of Reform Judaism, &quot;Judaism, from the days of the prophets, has proclaimed to
mankind the ideal of universal peace, striving for spiritual and physical disarmament of all nations. Judaism rejects
violence and relies upon moral education, love and sympathy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Judaism opposes violence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of nonviolence has roots in Judaism, going back to the Jerusalem Talmud of the middle third century.
While absolute nonviolence is not a requirement of Judaism, the religion so sharply restricts the use of violence, that
nonviolence often becomes the only way to fulfilling a life of truth, justice and peace, which Judaism considers to be
the three tools for the preservation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jewish law (past and present) does not permit any use of violence unless it is in self-defense. Any person that even
raises his hand in order to hit another person is called &quot;evil.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Avoidance of violence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient orders (like those) of wars for Israel to eradicate idol worshiping does not apply today. Jews are not
taught to glorify violence. The rabbis of the Talmud saw war as an avoidable evil. They taught: &quot;The sword comes to the
world because of delay of justice and through perversion of justice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews have always hated war and &quot;Shalom&quot; expresses the hope for peace, in Judaism war is evil, but at times a necessary
one, yet, Judaism teaches that one has to go to great length to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this moment, I realized that it was the tradition of this unique philosophy that brewed Marshall&apos;s tendency to,
combined with his unique experience at Detroit in 1943, think in a way that led his passion for seeking compassionate
and healthy relationship among people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reading of this book shall incorporate an important principle in mind - it&apos;s not just about learning technical
communication skills, it&apos;s more about appreciating the Jewish culture, a history that seeks, embrace, and promote peace
for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TG55ErfdaeY&quot; title=&quot;Christianity from Judaism to Constantine: Crash Course World History #11&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connect to Compassionate Nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./book-cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language, according to Marshall, plays the key role to help people stay connected to their compassionate nature.
This is a language technique called NVC (nonviolent communication). 4 Components of NVC are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observation&lt;/strong&gt; - The concrete actions we are observing that are affecting our well-being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling&lt;/strong&gt; - How we feel in relation to what we are observing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Needs&lt;/strong&gt; - The needs, values, desires, etc. that are creating our feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request&lt;/strong&gt; - The concrete actions we request in order to enrich our lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example that includes the 4 components: &quot;Felix, when I see two balls of soiled socks under the coffee table and another
three next to the TV, I feel irritated because I am needing more order in the rooms that we share in common. Would you
be willing to put your socks in your room or in the washing machine?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Communication That Blocks Compassion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Moralistic Judgements (≠ Value Judgments, like peace &amp;amp; freedom)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of moralistic judgements that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who don&apos;t act in harmony with our
values. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem with you is that you are selfish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She&apos;s lazy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are prejudiced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s inappropriate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticism, comparisons, diagnoses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classifying and judging people promote violence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making Comparisons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people have a sincere desire to make life miserable for themselves, they might learn to compare themselves to otherpeople&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Denial Of Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vague, impersonal forces&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I cleaned my room because I had to.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I drink because I am an alcoholic.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The actions of others&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I hit my child because he ran into the street.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dictates of authority&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I lied to the client because the boss told me to.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group pressure&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I started smoking because all my friends did.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional policies, rules, and regulations&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I have to suspend you for this infraction because it&apos;s the
school policy.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender roles, social roles, or age roles&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I hate going to work, but I do it because I am a husband and a
father.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncontrollable impulses&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I was overcome by my urge to eat the candy bar.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Observing without Evaluating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./separating-observation-and-evaluation.png&quot; alt=&quot;separating-observation-and-evaluation.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identifying and Expressing Feelings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressing our feelings are very important. Feelings are not being clearly expressed when the word &quot;feel&quot; is followed
by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;words such as &quot;that&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, as if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I feel that you should know better.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I feel like a failure.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I feel as if I&apos;m living with a wall.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the pronouns &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, &quot;it&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I feel I am constantly on call.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I feel it is useless.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;names or nouns referring to people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I feel Amy has been pretty responsible.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I feel my boss is being manipulative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we should&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distinguish between words that express actual feelings and those that describe what we think we are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;differentiate between words that describe what we think others are doing around us, and words that describe actual
feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking Responsibilities for Our Feelings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we receive negative messages, we should&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sense our own feelings and needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sense other&apos;s feelings and needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we don&apos;t value our needs, others may not either. Connect your feeling with your need using &lt;strong&gt;I feel ... because I
...&lt;/strong&gt; The more directly we can connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to response
compassionately to our needs. Someone on the other side might not say that explicitly, instead they express their needs
through judgements, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations. Judgements, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations
of others are all alienated expressions of our needs. There are some pre-defined and basic human needs that we can pick
up as we interpret other&apos;s needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autonomy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to choose one&apos;s dreams, goals, and values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to choose one&apos;s plan for fulfilling one&apos;s dreams, goals, and values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to celebrate the creation of life and dreams fulfilled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to celebrate losses: loved ones, dreams, etc. (mourning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;authenticity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creativity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interdependence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acceptance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appreciation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;closeness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consideration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contribution to the enrichment of life (to exercise one&apos;s power by giving that which contributes to life)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotional safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;empathy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;honesty (the empowering honesty that enables us to learn from our limitations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reassurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;respect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;warmth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;laughter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritual Communion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;beauty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;harmony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inspiration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical Nurturance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;movement, exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protection from life-threatening forms of life: viruses, bacteria, insects, predatory animals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sexual expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shelter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;touch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use positive language when making requests. When requests are worded in the negative, people&apos;s reaction is &quot;when I am
told not to do it, I feel I won&apos;t follow that.&quot; People are often confused as to what is actually being requested, and
furthermore, negative requests are likely to provoke resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use more often something like &quot;We&apos;d like you to ...&quot;. Avoid vague, abstract, or ambiguous phrasing and to word our
requests in the form of concrete actions that others can undertake. The clearer we are about what we want back, the more
likely it is that we&apos;ll get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Asking for a Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure the message we sent is the message that&apos;s received, ask the listener to reflect it back. On some occasions,
a simple question like &quot;Is that clear&quot; will suffice. Express appreciation when your listener tires to meet your request
for a reflection. For example: &quot;I&apos;m grateful to you for telling me what you heard. I can see that I didn&apos;t make myself
as clear as I&apos;d liked, so let me try again&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we express ourselves vulnerably, we often want to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what the listener is feeling&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I would like you to tell me how you feel about what I just said, and your reasons
for feeling as you do&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what the listener is thinking&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I&apos;d like you to tell me if you predict that my proposal would be success, and if
not, what you believe would prevent its success&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;whether the listener would be willing to take a particular action&lt;/strong&gt; - &quot;I&apos;d like you to tell me if you would be
willing to postpone our meeting for one week&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Requests v.s. Demands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requests are received as demands when others believe they will be blamed or punished if they do not comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Receiving Empathically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathy is a respectful understanding of what others are experiencing. Empathy occurs only when we have successfully
shed all preconceived ideas and judgments about them. It demands of you a reaction that cannot be prepared beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, however, instead of empathy, we tend to have a strong urge to give advice or reassurance and to explain our
own position or feeling. Empathy, on the other hand, requires focusing full attention on the other person&apos;s message. We
give to others the time and space they need to express themselves fully and to feel understood. It is often frustrating
for someone needing empathy to have us assume that they want reassurance or &quot;fix-it&quot; advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-empathically behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-upping - &quot;That&apos;s nothing; wait&apos;ll you hear what happened to me&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consoling - &quot;It wasn&apos;t your fault; you did the best you could&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story-telling - &quot;That reminds me of the time...&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shutting down - &quot;Cheer up. Don&apos;t feel so bad&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sympathizing - &quot;Oh, you poor thing...&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interrogating - &quot;When did this begin?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explaining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correcting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are thinking about people&apos;s words, listening to how they connect to our theories, we are looking at people - we
are not with them. The key ingredient of empathy is presence: we are wholly present with the other party and what they
are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listening For Feelings And Needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what others say, we only hear what they are observing, feeling, needing, and requesting. Behind intimidating
messages are simply people appealing to us to meet their needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sustaining Empathy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing others the opportunity to fully express themselves before turning our attention to solutions or requests for
relief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connecting Compassionately With Ourselves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid &quot;shoulding&quot; yourself. We want to take action out of the desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear,
guilt, shame, or obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip[Example]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Finally I realized that I was choosing to write the reports solely because I wanted the income they provided. As soon
as I recognized this, I never wrote another clinical report. I can&apos;t tell you how joyful I feel just thinking of how
many clinical reports I haven&apos;t written since that moment 35 years ago!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expressing Anger Fully&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger is a result of life-alienating thinking that is disconnected from needs. It indicates that we have moved up to our
head to analyze and judge somebody, rather than focus on which of our needs are not getting met. People do not hear our
pain when they believe they are at fault. To practice NVC, we need to proceed slowly, think carefully before we speak,
and often just take a deep breath and not speak at all. Learning the process and applying it both take time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-thought at the End (Not Part of the Book)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrive to seek peace between people is what a Jewish-tradition-thoughted people like Marshall most valued. NVC
techniques is one thing; what&apos;s more important is, from this book, valuing the value of peace from our heart. Once we
achieve that, we ourselves shall automatically and proactively seek and practice our own NVC ourselves. This makes me
interested in Jewish culture from now on :)&lt;/p&gt;
