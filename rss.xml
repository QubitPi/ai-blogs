If I teach you Maxwell

field&quot;, and &quot;how a moving charge could produce magnetic field&quot; so on and so forth. At the end of the day, you will be
making a perfect sense of what Maxell equations mean. It it only through this way you can start applying Maxwell&apos;s

&lt;p&gt;Management, and everything else in our live, goes like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management#History&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of management originated in ancient China, including possibly the first highly centralized bureaucratic state,
and the earliest (by the second century BC) example of an administration based on merit through testing. Some theorists
have cited ancient military texts as providing lessons for civilian managers. For example, Chinese general Sun Tzu in
his 6th-century BC work The Art of War recommends[citation needed] (when re-phrased in modern terminology) being aware
of and acting on strengths and weaknesses of both a manager&apos;s organization and a foe&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various ancient and medieval civilizations produced
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrors_for_princes&quot;&gt;mirrors for princes&lt;/a&gt;&quot; books, which aimed to advise new monarchs on
how to govern. Examples includes &lt;em&gt;The Prince&lt;/em&gt; by Italian author Niccolò Machiavelli&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/c/cKS8d0bp&quot;&gt;De Administrando Imperio&lt;/a&gt; of Constantine Porphyrogenitus. Constantine had this
written/compiled as advice to his son, Romanus. It functions as a practical manual, with a heavy foreign policy
emphasis, on how to be a good emperor. Unlike some advice written by emperors and historians, this one is not a
panegyric or solely praise; rather, it is candid and informative policy. Furthermore, it is (mostly) secular and
research-based; though, the bit on the &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;blasphemous&quot; Mohammed is obviously biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.J.H. Jenkins, in his introduction to the De Administrando Imperio, describes Constantine’s attempt at teaching
&quot;practical wisdom&quot; to his son by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important[Scrutiny of the historical documents]
writing or causing to be written histories of recent events and manuals of technical instruction on the various
departments of business and administration… Documents from the files of every branch of the administration, from the
foreign ministry, the treasury, the offices of ceremonial, were scrutinized and abstracted.
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of its key elements was a &quot;summary of the recent internal history, politics, and organization within the borders of
the empire.&quot; Far from being a piece of rhetoric or self-absorbed thought, the document contains enormous, albeit
intermittently erroneous, research and careful analysis. This is “no partial document of propaganda… to impress domestic
or foreign circles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Jenkins,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provincial governors and imperial envoys wrote historical and topographical reports on the areas of their jurisdiction
or assignment. Foreign ambassadors were diligently questioned as to the affairs of their respective countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things to note about the Administrando was its secret nature, having been written as advice for
Constantine&apos;s son, Romanus; it acts as part succession letter, part compilation, and part &quot;confidential&quot;
advice/information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brook, Andrew and Julian Wuerth,
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2023/entries/kant-mind&quot;&gt;Kant&apos;s View of the Mind and Consciousness of Self&lt;/a&gt;&quot;,
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2023 Edition), Edward N. Zalta &amp;amp; Uri Nodelman (eds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Sketch of Kant&apos;s View of the Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general structure, Kant&apos;s model of the mind was the dominant model in the empirical psychology that flowed from his
work and then again, after a hiatus during which behaviourism reigned supreme (roughly 1910 to 1965), toward the end of
the 20th century, especially in cognitive science. Central elements of the models of the mind of thinkers otherwise as
different as Sigmund Freud and Jerry Fodor are broadly Kantian, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three ideas define the basic shape (&apos;cognitive architecture&apos;) of Kant&apos;s model and one its dominant method. They have all
become part of the foundation of cognitive science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mind is a complex set of abilities (functions). (As Meerbote 1989 and many others have observed, Kant held a
functionalist view of the mind almost 200 years before functionalism was officially articulated in the 1960s by
Hilary Putnam and others.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The functions crucial for mental, knowledge-generating activity are spatio-temporal processing of, and application of
concepts to, sensory inputs. Cognition requires concepts as well as percepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These functions are forms of what Kant called synthesis. Synthesis (and the unity in consciousness required for
synthesis) are central to cognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three ideas are fundamental to most thinking about cognition now. Kant&apos;s most important method, the transcendental
method, is also at the heart of contemporary cognitive science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To study the mind, infer the conditions necessary for experience. Arguments having this structure are called
&lt;em&gt;transcendental arguments&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip
Translated into contemporary terms, the core of this method is inference to the best explanation, the method of
postulating unobservable mental mechanisms in order to explain observed behaviour.
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Kant thought that he could get more out of his transcendental arguments than just &apos;best explanations&apos;. He
thought that he could get &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; (experience independent) knowledge out of them. Kant had a tripartite doctrine of
the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;. He held that some features of the mind and its knowledge had &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; origins, i.e., must be in the
mind prior to experience (because using them is necessary to have experience). That mind and knowledge have these
features are &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; truths, i.e., necessary and universal. And we can come to know these truths, or that they are
&lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; at any rate, only by using &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; methods, i.e., we cannot learn these things from experience (B3) (Brook
1993). Kant thought that transcendental arguments were &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; or yielded the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; in all three ways.
Nonetheless, at the heart of this method is inference to the best explanation. When introspection fell out of favour
about 100 years ago, the alternative approach adopted was exactly this approach. Its nonempirical roots in Kant
notwithstanding, it is now the major method used by experimental cognitive scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::important
Other topics equally central to Kant&apos;s approach to the mind have hardly been discussed by cognitive science. These
include a kind of synthesis that for Kant was essential to minds like ours and what struck him as the most striking
features of consciousness of self. Far from his model having been superseded by cognitive science, some things central
to the model have not even been assimilated by it.
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kant&apos;s Critical Project and How the Mind Fits Into It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major works so far as Kant&apos;s views on the mind are concerned are the monumental &lt;strong&gt;Critique of Pure Reason (CPR)&lt;/strong&gt;
and his little, late &lt;strong&gt;Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View&lt;/strong&gt;, first published in 1798 only six years before his
death. Kant&apos;s view of the mind arose from his
&lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-development/&quot;&gt;general philosophical project&lt;/a&gt; in CPR the following way. Kant
aimed among other things to,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justify our conviction that physics, like mathematics, is a body of necessary and universal truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insulate religion, including belief in immortality, and free will from the corrosive effects of this very same
science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kant accepted without reservation that “God, freedom and immortality” (1781/7, Bxxx) exist but feared that, if science
were relevant to their existence at all, it would provide reasons to doubt that they exist. As he saw it and very
fortunately, science cannot touch these questions. “I have found it necessary to deny &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, ... in order to make
room for faith.” (Bxxx, his italics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laying the foundation for pursuit of the first aim, which as he saw it was no less than the aim of showing why physics
is a science, was what led Kant to his views about how the mind works. He approached the grounding of physics by asking:
What are the necessary conditions of experience? Put simply, he held that for our experience, and therefore our minds,
to be as they are, the way that our experience is tied together must reflect the way that, according to physics, says
objects in the world must be tied together. Seeing this connection also tells us a lot about what our minds must be
like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of the second aim, Kant criticized some arguments of his predecessors that entailed if sound that we can know
more about the mind&apos;s consciousness of itself than Kant could allow. Mounting these criticisms led him to some
extraordinarily penetrating ideas about our consciousness of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In CPR, Kant discussed the mind only in connection with his main projects, never in its own right, so his treatment is
remarkably scattered and sketchy. As he put it, “Enquiry … [into] the pure understanding itself, its possibility and the
cognitive faculties upon which it rests ... is of great importance for my chief purpose, ... [but] does not form an
essential part of it” (Axvii). Indeed, Kant offers no sustained, focussed discussion of the mind anywhere in his work
except the popular &lt;em&gt;Anthropology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the two chapters of CPR in which most of Kant&apos;s remarks on the mind occur, the chapter on the
Transcendental Deduction (TD) and the chapter on what he called Paralogisms (faulty arguments about the mind mounted by
his predecessors) were the two chapters that gave him the greatest difficulty. (They contain some of the most
impenetrable prose ever written.) Kant completely rewrote the main body of both chapters for the second edition
(though not the introductions, interestingly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two editions of CPR, there are seven main discussions of the mind. The first is in the Transcendental Aesthetic,
the second is in what is usually called the Metaphysical Deduction. Then there are two discussions of it in the
first-edition TD, in parts 1 to 3 of Section 2 and in the whole of Section 3 and two more in the second-edition TD. The
seventh and last is found in the first edition version of Kant&apos;s attack on the Paralogisms, in the course of which he
says things of the utmost interest about consciousness of and reference to self. (What little was retained of these
remarks in the second edition was moved to the completely rewritten TD.) For understanding Kant on the mind and
self-knowledge, the first edition of CPR is far more valuable than the second edition. Kant&apos;s discussion proceeds
through the following stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transcendental Aesthetic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kant calls the first stage the Transcendental Aesthetic. It is about what space and time must be like, and how we must
handle them, if our experience is to have the spatial and temporal properties that it has. This question about the
necessary conditions of experience is for Kant a &apos;transcendental&apos; question and the strategy of proceeding by trying to
find answers to such questions is, as we said, the strategy of transcendental argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Kant advances one of his most notorious views: that whatever it is that impinges on us from the mind-independent
world does not come located in a spatial nor even a temporal matrix (A37=B54fn.). Rather, it is the mind that organizes
this &apos;manifold of raw intuition&apos;, as he called it, spatially and temporally. The mind has two pure forms of intuition,
space and time, built into it to allow it to do so. (&apos;Pure&apos; means &apos;not derived from experience&apos;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Metaphysical Deduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aesthetic is about the conditions of experience, Kant&apos;s official project. The chapter leading up to the
Transcendental Deduction, The Clue to the Discovery of All Pure Concepts of the Understanding has a very different
starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from Aristotelian logic (the syllogisms and the formal concepts that Aristotle called &lt;em&gt;categories&lt;/em&gt;), Kant
proceeds by analysis to draw out the implications of these concepts and syllogisms for the conceptual structure (the
“function of thought in judgment”) within which all thought and experience must take place. The result is what Kant
called the Categories. That is to say, Kant tries to deduce the conceptual structure of experience from the components
of Aristotelian logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus, in Kant&apos;s thought about the mind early in CPR, there is not one central movement but two, one in the
Transcendental Aesthetic and the other in the Metaphysical Deduction. The first is a move up from experience (of
objects) to the necessary conditions of such experience. The second is a move down from the Aristotelian functions of
judgment to the concepts that we have to use in judging, namely, the Categories. One is inference up from experience,
the other deduction down from conceptual structures of the most abstract kind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transcendental Deduction, 1st Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we get to the second chapter of the Transcendental Logic, the brilliant and baffling Transcendental Deduction (TD).
Recall the two movements just discussed, the one from experience to its conditions and the one from Aristotelian
functions of judgment to the concepts that we must use in all judging (the Categories). This duality led Kant to his
famous question of right (&lt;em&gt;quid juris&lt;/em&gt;): with what right do we apply the Categories, which are not acquired from
experience, to the contents of experience?. Kant&apos;s problem here is not as arcane as it might seem. It reflects an
important question: How is it that the world as we experience it conforms to our logic? In briefest form, Kant thought
that the trick to showing how it is possible for the Categories to apply to experience is to show that it is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;
that they apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TD has two sides, though Kant never treats them separately. He once called them the objective and the subjective
deductions. The objective deduction is about the conceptual and other cognitive conditions of having representations of
objects. It is Kant&apos;s answer to the quid juris question. Exactly how the objective deduction goes is highly
controversial, a controversy that we will sidestep here. The subjective deduction is about what the mind, the
“subjective sources” of understanding, must as a consequence be like. The subjective deduction is what mainly interests
us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kant argues as follows. Our experiences have objects, that is, they are about something. The objects of our experiences
are discrete, unified particulars. To have such particulars available to it, the mind must construct them based on
sensible input. To construct them, the mind must do three kinds of synthesis. It must generate temporal and spatial
structure (Synthesis of Apprehension in Intuition). It must associate spatio-temporally structured items with other
spatio-temporally structured items (Synthesis of Reproduction in the Imagination). And it must recognize items using
concepts, the Categories in particular (Synthesis of Recognition in a Concept)&lt;/em&gt;. This threefold doctrine of synthesis is
one of the cornerstones of Kant&apos;s model of the mind. We will consider it in more detail in the next Section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &apos;deduction of the categories&apos; should now be complete. Strangely enough, the chapter has only nicely got started. In
the first edition version, for example, we have only reached about one-third of the way through the chapter. At this
point, Kant introduces the notion of transcendental apperception for the first time and the unity of such apperception,
the unity of consciousness. Evidently, something is happening (something, moreover, not at all well heralded in the
text)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now understand in more detail why Kant said that the subjective deduction is inessential. Since the objective
deduction is about the conditions of representations having objects, a better name for it might have been &apos;deduction of
the object&apos;. Similarly, a better name for the subjective deduction might have been &apos;the deduction of the subject&apos; or
&apos;the deduction of the subject&apos;s nature&apos;. The latter enquiry was inessential to Kant&apos;s main critical project because the
main project was to defend the synthetic &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; credentials of physics in the objective deduction. From this point
of view, anything uncovered about the nature and functioning of the mind was a happy accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attack on the Paralogisms, 1st Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter on the Paralogisms, the first of the three parts of Kant&apos;s second project, contains Kant&apos;s most original
insights into the nature of consciousness of the self. In the first edition, he seems to have achieved a stable position
on self-consciousness only as late as this chapter. Certainly his position was not stable in TD. Even his famous term
for consciousness of self, &apos;I think&apos;, occurs for the first time only in the introduction to the chapter on the
Paralogisms. His target is claims that we know what the mind is like. Whatever the merits of Kant&apos;s attack on these
claims, in the course of mounting it, he made some very deep-running observations about consciousness and knowledge of
self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip
To summarize: in the first edition, TD contains most of what Kant had to say about synthesis and unity, but little on
the nature of consciousness of self. The chapter on the Paralogisms contains most of what he has to say about
consciousness of self.
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Two Discussions in the 2nd-edition TD and Other Discussions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other new material prepared for the second edition, we find a first gloss on the topic of self-consciousness as early
as the Aesthetic (B68). The mind also appears in a new passage called the Refutation of Idealism, where Kant attempts to
tie the possibility of one sort of consciousness of self to consciousness of permanence in something other than
ourselves, in a way he thought to be inconsistent with Berkeleian idealism. This new Refutation of Idealism has often
been viewed as a replacement for the argument against the Fourth Paralogism of the first edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in his work, the only sustained discussion of the mind and consciousness is, as we said, his little, late
&lt;strong&gt;Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View&lt;/strong&gt;. By &apos;anthropology&apos; Kant meant the study of human beings from the point of
view of their (psychologically-controlled) behaviour, especially their behaviour toward one another, and of the things
revealed in behaviour such as character. Though Kant sometimes contrasted anthropology as a legitimate study with what
he understood empirical psychology to be, namely, psychology based on introspective observation, he meant by
anthropology something fairly close to what we now mean by behavioural or experimental psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kant&apos;s View of the Mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Method&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning now to Kant&apos;s view of the mind, we will start with a point about method: Kant held surprisingly strong and not
entirely consistent views on the empirical study of the mind. The empirical method for doing psychology that Kant
discussed was introspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes he held such study to be hopeless. The key text on psychology is in The Metaphysical Foundations of Natural
Science. There Kant tell us that “the empirical doctrine of the soul … must remain even further removed than chemistry
from the rank of what may be called a natural science proper”. (In Kant&apos;s defence, there was nothing resembling a single
unified theory of chemical reactions in his time.) The contents of introspection, in his terms inner sense, cannot be
studied scientifically for at least 5 reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having only one universal dimension and one that they are only represented to have at that, namely, distribution in
time, the contents of inner sense cannot be quantified; thus no mathematical model of them is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The manifold of internal observation is separated only by mere thought”. That is to say, only the introspective
observer distinguishes the items one from another; there are no real distinctions among the items themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These items “cannot be kept separate” in a way that would allow us to connect them again “at will”, by which Kant
presumably means, according to the dictates of our developing theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Another thinking subject does not submit to our investigations in such a way as to be conformable to our purposes” -
the only thinking subject whose inner sense one can investigate is oneself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Even the observation itself alters and distorts the state of the object observed”. Indeed, introspection can be bad
for the health: it is a road to “mental illness” (&apos;Illuminism and Terrorism&apos;, 1798, Ak. VII:133; see 161).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these critical passages, it is not clear why he didn&apos;t respect what he called anthropology more highly as an
empirical study of the mind, given that he himself did it. He did so elsewhere. In the Anthropology, for example, he
links &apos;self-observation&apos; and observation of others and calls them both sources of anthropology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever, no kind of empirical psychology can yield necessary truths about the mind. In the light of this limitation,
how &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; we study the mind? Kant&apos;s answer was: transcendental method using transcendental arguments (notions
introduced earlier). If we cannot observe the connections among the denizens of inner sense to any purpose, we can study
what the mind &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be like and what capacities and structures (in Kant&apos;s jargon, faculties) it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have if it is to
represent things as it does. With this method we can find universally true, that is to say, &apos;transcendental&apos;
psychological propositions. We have already seen what some of them are: minds must be able to synthesize and minds must
have a distinctive unity, for example. Let us turn now to these substantive claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Synthesis and Faculties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already discussed Kant&apos;s view of the mind&apos;s handling of space and time, so we can proceed directly to his
doctrine of synthesis. As Kant put it in one of his most famous passages, “&lt;strong&gt;Concepts without intuitions are empty,
intuitions without concepts are blind&lt;/strong&gt;”. Experience requires both percepts and concepts. As we might say now, to
discriminate, we need information; but for information to be of any use to us, we must organize the information. This
organization is provided by acts of synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;em&gt;synthesis&lt;/em&gt;, in its most general sense, I understand the act of putting different representations together, and of
grasping what is manifold in them in one knowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the doctrine of space and time is the first major part of his model of the mind, the doctrine of synthesis is the
second. Kant claimed, as we saw earlier, that three kinds of synthesis are required to organize information, namely
apprehending in intuition, reproducing in imagination, and recognizing in concepts. Each of the three kinds of synthesis
relates to a different aspect of Kant&apos;s fundamental duality of intuition and concept. Synthesis of apprehension concerns
raw perceptual input, synthesis of recognition concerns concepts, and synthesis of reproduction in imagination allows
the mind to go from the one to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also relate to three fundamental faculties of the mind. One is the province of Sensibility, one is the province of
Understanding, and the one in the middle is the province of a faculty that has a far less settled position than the
other two, namely, Imagination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two, apprehension and reproduction, are inseparable; one cannot occur without the other. The third,
recognition, requires the other two but is not required by them. It seems that only the third requires the use of
concepts; this problem of non-concept-using syntheses and their relationship to use of the categories becomes a
substantial issue in the second edition, where Kant tries to save the universality of the objective deduction by arguing
that all three kinds of syntheses are required to represent objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts of synthesis are performed on that to which we are passive in experience, namely intuitions (&lt;em&gt;Anschauungen&lt;/em&gt;).
Intuitions are quite different from sense-data as classically understood; we can become conscious of intuitions only
after acts of synthesis and only by inference from these acts, not directly. Thus they are something more like
theoretical entities (better, events) postulated to explain something in what we do recognize. What they explain is the
non-conceptual element in representations, an element over which we have no control. Intuitions determine how our
representations will serve to confirm or refute theories, aid or impede our efforts to reach various goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Synthesis of Apprehension in Intuition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Embarrassingly I introduced a &quot;common&quot; library, named as such, in a team environment a couple of decades back.
I didn&apos;t really understand the dynamics back then of what could happen in a loosely-coordinated team setting in just a
matter of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I introduced it I thought I made it clear and also documented that it&apos;s for things we&apos;d all agree we find useful on
a daily basis, that it&apos;s intended to be a minimalist library, and that the library should depend on nothing else besides
the standard library so that it&apos;s as easy to deploy as possible in new projects. My thinking at the time was that it was
our own little extension to the standard library for things that, in our particular domain, we found useful on a daily
basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it started off well enough. We started off with a math library (&lt;code&gt;common/math*&lt;/code&gt;) of routines which we all used on a
daily basis, since we were working on computer graphics which was often heavy on the linear algebra. And since we were
often interoping with C code, we agreed on some useful utility functions like find_index which, unlike std::find in C++,
would return an index to an element found in a sequence instead of an iterator which mimicked how our C functions worked
-- things of this sort -- a little bit eclectic but minimalist and widely used enough to remain familiar and practical
to everyone, and instant familiarity is an extremely important criteria as I see it in trying to make anything that is
&quot;common&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; since if it truly is &quot;common&quot;, it should have that familiar quality about it as a result of its
wide adoption and daily usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over time the design intentions of the library slipped out of my fingers as people started to add things they used
personally that they merely thought might be of use to someone else, only to find no one else using it. And later
someone started adding functions that depended on OpenGL for common GL-related routines. Further on we adopted Qt and
people started adding code that depended on Qt, so already the common library was dependent on two external libraries.
At some point someone added common shader routines which was dependent on our application-specific shader library, and
at that point you couldn&apos;t even deploy it in a new project without bringing in Qt, OGL, and our application-specific
shader library and writing a non-trivial build script for your project. So it turned into this eclectic, interdependent
mess. Later on people even added GUI-dependent code to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&apos;ve also found by debating what should and shouldn&apos;t go into this library that what is considered &quot;common&quot; can
easily turn into a very subjective idea if you don&apos;t set a very hard line rule that what&apos;s &quot;common&quot; is what everyone
tends to find useful on a daily basis. Any loosening of the standards and it quickly degrades from things everyone finds
useful on a daily basis to something a single developer finds useful that might have the possibility of being beneficial
to someone else, and at that point the library degrades into an eclectic mess really fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But furthermore when you reach that point, some developers can start adding things for the simple reason that they don&apos;t
like the programming language. They might not like the syntax of a for loop or a function call, at which point the
library is starting to get filled with things that&apos;s just fighting the fundamental syntax of the language, replacing a
couple of lines of straightforward code which isn&apos;t really duplicating any logic down to a single terse line of exotic
code only familiar to the developer who introduced such a shorthand. Then such a developer might start adding more
functionality to the common library implemented using such shorthands, at which point significant sections of the common
library become interwoven with these exotic shorthands which might seem beautiful and intuitive to the developer who
introduced it but ugly and foreign and hard to understand for everyone else. And at that point I think you know that any
hope of making something truly &quot;common&quot; is lost, since &quot;common&quot; and &quot;unfamiliar&quot; are polar opposite ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&apos;s all kinds of cans of worms there, at least in a loosely-coordinated team environment, with a library with
ambitions as broad and as generalized as just &quot;commonly-used stuff&quot;. And while the underlying problem might have been
the loose coordination above all else, at least multiple libraries intended to serve a more singular purpose, like a
library intended to provide math routines and nothing else, probably wouldn&apos;t degrade as significantly in terms of its
design purity and dependencies as a &quot;common&quot; library. So in retrospect I think it would be much better to err on the
side of libraries which have much more clear design intentions. I&apos;ve also found over the years that narrow in purpose
and narrow in applicability are radically different ideas. Often the most widely applicable things are the narrowest and
most singular in purpose, since you can then say, &quot;aha, this is exactly what I need&quot;, as opposed to wading through an
eclectic library of disparate functionality trying to see if it has something you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I&apos;m admittedly at least a little bit impractical and care maybe a bit too much about aesthetics, but the way I tend
to perceive my idea of a library&apos;s quality (and maybe even &quot;beauty&quot;) is judged more by its weakest link than its
strongest, in a similar way that if you presented me the most appetitizing food in the world but, on the same plate, put
something rotting on there that smells really bad, I tend to want to reject the entire plate. And if you&apos;re like me in
that regard and make something that invites all sorts of additions as something called &quot;common&quot;, you might find yourself
looking at that analogical plate with something rotting on the side. So likewise I think it&apos;s good if a library is
organized and named and documented in a way such that it doesn&apos;t invite more and more and more additions over time. And
that can even apply to your personal creations, since I&apos;ve certainly created some rotten stuff here and there, and it
&quot;taints&quot; a lot less if it&apos;s not being added to the biggest plate. Separating things out into small, very singular
libraries has a tendency to better decouple code as well, if only by the sheer virtue that it becomes far less
convenient to start coupling everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::tip
Code deduplication has been hammered into me over the years but I feel like I should try it this time around.
:::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I might suggest in your case is to start to take it easy on code deduplication. I&apos;m not saying to copy and paste
big snippets of poorly-tested, error-prone code around or anything of this sort, or duplicating huge amounts of
non-trivial code that has a decent probability of requiring changes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But especially if you are of the mindset to create a &quot;common&quot; library, for which I assume your desire is to create
something widely-applicable, highly reusable, and perhaps ideally something you find just as useful today as you do a
decade from now, then sometimes you might even need or want some duplication to achieve this elusive quality. Because
the duplication might actually serve as a decoupling mechanism. It&apos;s like if you want to separate a video player from an
MP3 player, then you at least have to duplicate some things like batteries and hard drives. They can&apos;t share these
things or else they&apos;re indivisibly coupled and cannot be used independently of each other, and at that point people
might not be interested in the device anymore if all they want to do is play MP3s. But some time after you split these
two devices apart, you might find that the MP3 player can benefit from a different battery design or smaller hard drive
than the video player, at which point you&apos;re no longer duplicating anything; what initially started out as duplication
to allow this interdependent device to split into two separate, independent devices might later turn out to yield
designs and implementations that are no longer redundant at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s worth considering things from the perspective of the one using a library. Would you actually want to use a library
that minimizes code duplication? Chances are that you won&apos;t because one that does will naturally depend on other
libraries. And those other libraries might depend on other libraries to avoid duplicating their code, and so on, until
you might need to import/link 50 different libraries to just to get some basic functionality like loading and playing an
audio file, and that becomes very unwieldy. Meanwhile if such an audio library deliberately chose to duplicate some
things here and there to achieve its independence, it becomes so much easier to use in new projects, and chances are
that it won&apos;t need to be updated nearly as often since it won&apos;t need to change as a result of one its dependent external
libraries changing which might be trying to fulfill a much more generalized purpose than what the audio library needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sometimes it&apos;s worth deliberately choosing to duplicate a little bit (consciously, never out of laziness -- actually
out of diligence) in order to decouple a library and make it independent because, through that independence, it achieves
a wider range of practical applicability and even stability (no more afferent couplings). If you want to design the most
reusable libraries possible that will last you from one project to the next and over the years, then on top of narrowing
its scope to the minimum, I would actually suggest considering duplicating a little bit here. And naturally write unit
tests and make sure it&apos;s really thoroughly tested and reliable at what it&apos;s doing. This is only for the libraries that
you really want to take the time to generalize to a point that goes far beyond a single project.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;468&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHlFSHPJrQU?si=Su1B6cKj59UZN4B6&quot; title=&quot;Oliver Twist (2005)&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Twist#Major_themes_and_symbols&quot;&gt;Major Themes and Symbols&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Oliver Twist, Dickens mixes grim realism with merciless satire to describe the effects of industrialism on
19th-century England and to criticise the harsh new Poor Laws. &lt;strong&gt;Oliver&lt;/strong&gt;, an innocent child, is trapped in a world
where his only options seem to be the workhouse, a life of crime symbolised by Fagin&apos;s gang, a prison, or an early
grave. From this unpromising industrial/institutional setting, however, a fairy tale also emerges. In the midst of
corruption and degradation, the essentially passive Oliver &lt;em&gt;remains pure-hearted; he steers away from evil when those
around him give in to it&lt;/em&gt;, and in proper fairy-tale fashion, he eventually receives his reward - leaving for a peaceful
life in the country, surrounded by kind friends. On the way to this happy ending, Dickens explores the kind of life an
outcast, orphan boy could expect to lead in 1830s London&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nancy&lt;/strong&gt;, by contrast, redeems herself at the cost of her own life and dies in a prayerful pose. She is one of the few
characters in Oliver Twist to display much ambivalence. Her storyline in the novel strongly reflects themes of domestic
violence and psychological abuse at the hands of Bill. Although Nancy is a full-fledged criminal, indoctrinated and
trained by Fagin since childhood, she retains enough empathy to repent her role in Oliver&apos;s kidnapping, and to take
steps to try to atone. As one of Fagin&apos;s victims, corrupted but not yet morally dead, she gives eloquent voice to the
horrors of the old man&apos;s little criminal empire. She wants to save Oliver from a similar fate; at the same time, she
recoils from the idea of turning traitor, especially to Bill Sikes, whom she loves. When Dickens was later criticised
for giving to a &quot;thieving, whoring slut of the streets&quot; such an unaccountable reversal of character, he ascribed her
change of heart to &quot;the last fair drop of water at the bottom of a dried-up, weed-choked well&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leadership is, at root, about Influencing Others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the movie symbolizes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule&quot;&gt;Golden Rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with the huge pressure of meeting deadlines or attaining shareholder profitability targets, in most cases,
the Golden Rule tends to be forgotten by employers. In this respect, business leaders need to stop putting corporate
priorities and greed above the needs of employees. I am not arguing for an end of profit, but to prevent businesses from
profiting from employee harm and potential exploitation. Profits should be a product of an organisation’s purpose, but
not the purpose of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;살다 보면 참 잊기 쉬운 말이다. &apos;인간&apos;. 신기하게 인간이 살고 있는 세상이고 인간을 위해 쌓아 올린 세상인데 인간이 없다. 아니, 정확하게는
인간성이 없다. 도로 위에 수많은 난폭, 폭력 운전자들. 직장, 일이라는 이유로 인간다움을 마음 한편에 접어두라는 사람들. 돈 없고 힘없으면
무시당해도 되고 서러워도 아무도 신경 쓰지 않는 사람들. 다수가 불편하면 외면당해도 되는 소수들. 어리고 학생이면 선택할 수 없고 저항하면

어떻게 &apos;인생의 드라마&apos;가 되었는지 궁금할 것입니다. 놀랍게도 그랬습니다. 박동훈과 이지안은 서로를 인간 대 인간으로 완전히 이해했고,
서로에게 큰 위로가 되었습니다. 이지안을 돕는 과정을 통해 박동훈 역시 자신의 내면에서 다른 것을 발견하고, 자신을 더 사랑하는 것에서
벗어나 더 적극적으로 살아갈 수 있었고, 이지안은 다른 사람들과 달리 자신에게 &apos;4배 이상&apos; 잘해주는 박동훈 같은 사람을 만난 이후 &apos;처음
살아보는 삶&apos;을 살게 되었습니다. 이 둘이 어둠 속에서 서로에게 빛이 되고 마침내 터널을 벗어나면, 시청자들은 이 힘들고 외로운 삶 속에서
희망을 볼 수 있는 것처럼 경험합니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;우울한 사람들을 보지만, 어쩐지 희망적인 느낌을 줍니다. 슬픈 사람들을 보지만, 어쩐지 미소를 짓게 만듭니다. 배경에는 추운 겨울날이지만,
여러분의 마음은 한없이 따뜻해질 것입니다. 사회적으로 소외되고 외로운 사람들이 모여서 이야기하는 것 같습니다. &quot;괜찮아요. 이 세상은 여전히
살 가치가 있어요.&quot; 무엇보다도, 여러분의 삶에서 진정한 사람들을 만나거나, 그들 중 한 명이 되고 싶다는 생각을 하게 만듭니다. 어떤 판단도
없이 힘든 시기를 겪고 있는 그 사람을 볼 때, 여러분은 그 사람의 편이 될 수 있는 사람으로 성장하고 싶습니다. 더 중요한 것은, 그런
방식으로, 여러분은 인간이 할 수 있는 최고의 가치를 실천하는 것이 여러분의 삶에서 더 많은 의미를 찾을 수 있기 때문에 더 많은 것을 얻을
수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;어떻게 보면 인생은 외적인 힘과 내적인 힘의 싸움이고, 어떤 일이 있어도 내적인 힘이 있으면 견딜 수 있습니다. (박동훈)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
