  George Berkeley was an Anglo-Irish philosopher who is regarded as the founder of "immaterialism", which was later
  referred to as "subjective idealism". As a leading figure in the empiricism movement, he had a profound influence on
  the views of other thinkers, especially Immanuel Kant and David Hume. Berkeley argued against Isaac Newton's doctrine
  of absolute space, time and motion in De Motu. His arguments were a notable precursor to those of Ernst Mach and
  Albert Einstein. Interest in Berkeley's ideas and works increased greatly after World War II because they tackled
  many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century, such as the problems of perception, the
  difference between primary and secondary qualities, and the importance of language.

Of all treatises written on the subject in the eighteenth century, Berkeley's
[_Analyst_][The Works Of George Berkeley Vol. 3] was the most sustained and penetrating critique of the methodology of
the infinitesimal calculus. This work foreshadows the foundational research of the nineteenth century, and provides a
link between the mathematical preoccupations of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and those of the nineteenth.

Broadly speaking, the mathematicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries - and in particular Newton, Leibniz,
and Euler - had been more concerned with exploiting and extending the techniques of the differential and integral
calculus than with tidying its foundations. The mathematicians of the early nineteenth century, in contrast, bent their
efforts towards placing the calculus on an unobjectionable footing - towards chasing away the obscurities that
surrounded such notions as _infinitesimal_, _limit_, and _differential_. This project was pursued during the first
two-thirds of the nineteenth century by such mathematicians as Gauss, Bolzano, Cauchy, Abel, Fourier, Riemann, and
Weierstrass. Their investigations into the foundations of real analysis in turn inspired the later studies by Dedekind,
Cantor, Frege, Peano, Peirce, Russell, and Hilbert of set-theory, logic, and the foundations of arithmetic.

Berkeley's [_Analyst_][The Works Of George Berkeley Vol. 3] prefigures this entire development, and his
philosophically-motivated criticisms of the Newtonian mathematics of the eighteenth century raise many issues that will
loom large in the selections that follow. These issues may be loosely grouped under 4 headings.

1. His critique of _infinitesimals_ raises not only the issue of justifying the central concepts of the calculus but 
   also the more general issue of the legitimacy of the actual infinite in mathematics.
2. Berkeley, as befits the empiricist philosopher who wrote An essay towards a new theory of vision (1709), makes acute
   comments about the relationship between geometry, human visual perception, and the foundations of the calculus.
3. In numerous places Berkeley discusses the problem of the _reference_ of mathematical expressions; declaring, for
   instance, in _Of infinites_, that "This plain to me we ought to use no sign without an idea answering to it"; __one
   of his cardinal criticisms of Newton is that infinitesimals can have no empirical reference__. This topic of the
   reference of mathematical expressions (a topic on which Berkeley occasionally shifted his position) was to be central
   to the development of algebra during the nineteenth century
4. All these mathematical issues - in analysis, geometry, and algebra - are intertwined in Berkeley's thought with more
   general concerns about mathematical truth, the rigour of demonstrations, the applicability of mathematics to the
   empirical world, and the scope and limits of mathematical knowledge. Philosophers more often react to developments in
   mathematics than anticipate them, and in modern times perhaps only Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant can be said to have
   equalled Berkeley's insight into the foundations of mathematics .
