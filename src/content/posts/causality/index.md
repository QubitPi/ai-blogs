  I don't believe in any religion, but the notion of Buddhism's idea of Karma, i.e. cause and effect, seems to prevail
  in many aspects of our lives and works, which is why I was drawn upon this topic of "Causality"

This article is an overview of the Cause and Effect as the Principle of Causality, establishing one event or action as
the direct result of another, from the following 4 perspectives:

1. Kant's Metaphysics
2. Aristotle's Philosophy
3. Chinese Ying-Yang
4. Buddhism's Karma

Kant's  Metaphysics
-------------------

:::note[References]

- Wikipedia, [_Causality_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality)

:::

The nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as metaphysics. __Kant__ thought that time and space
were notions prior to human understanding of the progress or evolution of the world, and he also recognized the priority
of causality. But he did not have the understanding that came with knowledge of [Minkowski geometry] and the
[Special Theory of Relativity], that the notion of causality can be used as a prior foundation from which to
[construct notions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_structure) of time and space

Kant primarily discusses the concept of cause and effect in the _Division One - Book II - Section III - 3.B. Second
Analogy his "Critique of Pure Reason".

Buddhist Philosophy
-------------------

All the classic Buddhist schools teach [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma) (Sanskrit: कर्म). "The law of karma is a special instance of the law of cause and effect, according to which all our actions of body, speech, and mind are causes and all our experiences are their effects."

Western Philosophy
------------------

In Book II, Chapter 3 of his work "[Physics](https://trello.com/c/fIM7TADB)", __Aristotle__ identified 4 kinds of answer
or explanatory mode to various "Why?" questions:

1. _Material Cause_: Aristotle considers the material "cause" of an object as equivalent to the nature of the raw
   material out of which the object is composed.

   Whereas modern Physics looks to simple bodies, Aristotle's Physics took a more general viewpoint, and treated living 
   things as exemplary. Nevertheless, he argued that simple natural bodies such as earth, fire, air, and water also
   showed signs of having their own innate sources of motion, change, and rest. Fire, for example, carries things
   upwards, unless stopped from doing so. Things formed by human artifice, such as beds and cloaks, have no innate
   tendency to become beds or cloaks.

2. _Formal Cause_: Aristotle considers the formal "cause" as describing the pattern or form which when present makes
   matter into a particular type of thing, which we recognize as being of that particular type.
3. _Efficient Cause_: Aristotle defines the agent or efficient "cause" of an object as that which causes change and
   drives transient motion (such as a painter painting a house) (see Aristotle, _Physics_ II 3, 194b29). In many cases,
   this is simply the thing that brings something about. For example, in the case of a statue, it is the person
   chiseling away which transforms a block of marble into a statue. [According to Lloyd, of the four causes, only this
   one is what is meant by the modern English word "cause" in ordinary speech](https://trello.com/c/V3QZplQN).
4. _Final Cause_: the criterion of completion, or the end; it may refer to an action or to an inanimate process.
   Examples: Socrates takes a walk after dinner for the sake of his health; earth falls to the lowest level because that
   is its nature.
