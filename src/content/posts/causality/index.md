  I don't believe in any religion, but the notion of Buddhism's idea of Karma, i.e. cause and effect, seems to prevail
  in many aspects of our lives and works, which is why I was drawn upon this topic of "Causality"

This article is an overview of the Cause and Effect as the Principle of Causality, establishing one event or action as
the direct result of another, from the following 4 perspectives:

1. Kant's Metaphysics
2. Aristotle's Philosophy
3. Chinese Ying-Yang
4. Buddhism's Karma

Kant's  Metaphysics
-------------------

The nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as metaphysics. __Kant__ primarily discusses the concept of cause and effect in the __Division One - Book II - Section III - 3.B. Second
analogy__ of his [_Critique of Pure Reason_](https://leadership.qubitpi.org/posts/kritik-der-reinen-vernunft/):

:::tip[Law of Causality - 1st Version]
Everything that happens (begins to be) presupposes something which it follows in accordance with a rule.
:::

:::tip[Law of Causality - 2nd Version]
All alterations occur in accordance with the law of the connection of cause and effect.

He thought that time and space
were notions prior to human understanding of the progress or evolution of the world, and he also recognized __the priority
of causality__. But he did not have the understanding that came with knowledge of [Minkowski geometry] and the
[Special Theory of Relativity], that the notion of causality can be used as a prior foundation from which to
[construct notions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_structure) of time and space[^1]

Aristotle's Philosophy
----------------------

In Book II, Chapter 3 of his work "[Physics](https://trello.com/c/fIM7TADB)", __Aristotle__ considered in how many senses "because" may answer the
question "why". He believes understanding a thing means knowing its "how and why" and gave the following rough classification of the causal determinants of things: 

:::tip[The meaning of physics in Aristotle]

Aristotle's _Physics_ deals with the most general (philosophical) principles of natural or __moving__ things, both living and non-living, rather than physical theories (in the modern sense) or investigations of the particular contents of the universe. The chief purpose of the work is to discover the principles and causes of change, or movement, or motion, especially that of natural wholes (mostly living things, but also inanimate wholes like the cosmos).[^2]

Therefore the "_process_" in the discussion below is nothing but just the movement of a thing from one place to another,
such as a vehicle head toward San Francisco from Los Angeles. 

:::

1. _Material Cause_ - _The existence of material for the generating process to start from_. For example, bronze _for_
   the statue
2. _Formal Cause_ - _The material must receives the form (characteristics) of the type which conforms to its own definition_
3. _Efficient Cause_ - _There must be something to initiate a process for change and cease the process when completed_, i.e. changing from what it was to what it is to be. [According to Lloyd, of the four causes, only this
   one is what is meant by the modern English word "cause" in ordinary speech](https://trello.com/c/V3QZplQN).
4. _Final Cause_ - The _end_ or purpose of the process being initiated. For instance, people exercise for their health. 

Buddhist Philosophy
-------------------

All the classic Buddhist schools teach [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma) (Sanskrit: कर्म). "The law of karma is a special instance of the law of cause and effect, according to which all our actions of body, speech, and mind are causes and all our experiences are their effects."
