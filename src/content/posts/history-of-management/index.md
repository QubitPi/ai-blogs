My background of Physics told me to truly master a concept, one cannot ignore its origin. If I teach you Maxwell
equations now you would end up with a blank mind. You need to start with "what is an electric charge", "what is a
field", and "how a moving charge could produce magnetic field" so on and so forth. At the end of the day, you will be
making a perfect sense of what Maxell equations mean. It it only through this way you can start applying Maxwell's
equations and solve real-worl problems.

Management, and everything else in our live, goes like this.

The field of management originated in ancient China, including possibly the first highly centralized bureaucratic state,
and the earliest (by the second century BC) example of an administration based on merit through testing. Some theorists
have cited ancient military texts as providing lessons for civilian managers. For example, Chinese general Sun Tzu in
his 6th-century BC work The Art of War recommends[citation needed] (when re-phrased in modern terminology) being aware
of and acting on strengths and weaknesses of both a manager's organization and a foe's.

The writings of influential Chinese Legalist philosopher Shen Buhai (申子) may be considered to embody a rare premodern example
of abstract theory of administration.

Various ancient and medieval civilizations produced
"[mirrors for princes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrors_for_princes)" books, which aimed to advise new monarchs on
how to govern. Examples includes _The Prince_ by Italian author Niccolò Machiavelli

in the [De Administrando Imperio](https://trello.com/c/cKS8d0bp) of Constantine Porphyrogenitus. Constantine had this
written/compiled as advice to his son, Romanus. It functions as a practical manual, with a heavy foreign policy
emphasis, on how to be a good emperor. Unlike some advice written by emperors and historians, this one is not a
panegyric or solely praise; rather, it is candid and informative policy. Furthermore, it is (mostly) secular and
research-based; though, the bit on the "obscene" and "blasphemous" Mohammed is obviously biased.

R.J.H. Jenkins, in his introduction to the De Administrando Imperio, describes Constantine’s attempt at teaching
"practical wisdom" to his son by:

:::important[Scrutiny of the historical documents]
writing or causing to be written histories of recent events and manuals of technical instruction on the various
departments of business and administration… Documents from the files of every branch of the administration, from the
foreign ministry, the treasury, the offices of ceremonial, were scrutinized and abstracted.
:::

One of its key elements was a "summary of the recent internal history, politics, and organization within the borders of
the empire." Far from being a piece of rhetoric or self-absorbed thought, the document contains enormous, albeit
intermittently erroneous, research and careful analysis. This is “no partial document of propaganda… to impress domestic
or foreign circles."

From Jenkins,

> Provincial governors and imperial envoys wrote historical and topographical reports on the areas of their jurisdiction
> or assignment. Foreign ambassadors were diligently questioned as to the affairs of their respective countries.

One of the interesting things to note about the Administrando was its secret nature, having been written as advice for
Constantine's son, Romanus; it acts as part succession letter, part compilation, and part "confidential"
advice/information.

As the emperor puts it,

:::tip[On "Knowing the difference between being-managed"]
it is not for those who wish to govern lawfully to copy and emulate what has been ill done by some out of ignorance or
arrogance, but rather to have the glorious deeds of those who have ruled lawfully and righteously as noble pictures set
up for an example to be copied, and after their pattern to strive himself also to direct all that he does... it may
greatly advantage you… [to know] the difference between other nations, their origins and customs and manner of life, and
the position and climate of the land they dwell in...
