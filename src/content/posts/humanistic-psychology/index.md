_Humanistic psychology_ is a psychological perspective that arose in the mid-20th century in answer to two theories:
Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory and B. F. Skinner's behaviorism. Abraham Maslow, in this context, established
the need for a "third force" in psychology.

Hierarchy of Needs
------------------

:::

Maslow described human needs as ordered in a prepotent hierarchy - a pressing need would need to be mostly satisfied
before someone would give their attention to the next highest need. None of his published works included a visual
representation of the hierarchy.

![An interpretation of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, represented as a pyramid, with the more basic needs at the bottom](./Maslow-Hierarchy-of-Needs.svg "Error loading Maslow-Hierarchy-of-Needs.svg")

The pyramidal diagram illustrating the Maslow needs hierarchy may have been created by a psychology textbook publisher
as an illustrative device. This now iconic pyramid frequently depicts the spectrum of human needs, both physical and
psychological, as accompaniment to articles describing Maslow's needs theory and may give the impression that the
hierarchy of needs is a fixed and rigid sequence of progression. Yet, starting with the first publication of his theory
in 1943, Maslow described human needs as being relatively fluid—with many needs being present in a person simultaneously

According to Maslow's theory, when a human being ascends the levels of the hierarchy having fulfilled the needs in the
hierarchy, one may eventually achieve self-actualization. Late in life, Maslow came to conclude that self-actualization
was not an automatic outcome of satisfying the other human needs.

Human needs as identified by Maslow:

- At the bottom of the hierarchy are the "basic needs or physiological needs" of a human being: food, water, sleep, sex,
  homeostasis, and excretion.
- The next level is "safety needs: security, order, and stability". These two steps are important to the physical
  survival of the person. Once individuals have basic nutrition, shelter and safety, they attempt to accomplish more.
- The third level of need is "love and belonging", which are psychological needs; when individuals have taken care of
  themselves physically, they are ready to share themselves with others, such as with family and friends.
- The fourth level is achieved when individuals feel comfortable with what they have accomplished. This is the "esteem"
  level, the need to be competent and recognized, such as through status and level of success.
- Then there is the "cognitive" level, where individuals intellectually stimulate themselves and explore.
- After that is the "aesthetic" level, which is the need for harmony, order and beauty.
- At the top of the pyramid, "need for self-actualization" occurs when individuals reach a state of harmony and
  understanding because they are engaged in achieving their full potential. Once a person has reached the
  self-actualization state they focus on themselves and try to build their own image. They may look at this in terms of
  feelings such as self-confidence or by accomplishing a set goal.

The first four levels are known as deficit needs or D-needs. This means that if there are not enough of one of those
four needs, there will be a need to get it. Getting them brings a feeling of contentment. These needs alone are not
motivating.

Maslow wrote that there are certain conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the basic needs to be satisfied. For
example, freedom of speech, freedom to express oneself, and freedom to seek new information
(_A Theory of Human Motivation_) are a few of the prerequisites. Any blockages of these freedoms could prevent the
satisfaction of the basic needs.

Self-actualization
------------------

Maslow defined self-actualization as achieving the fullest use of one's talents and interests—the need "to become
everything that one is capable of becoming". As implied by its name, self-actualization is highly individualistic and
reflects Maslow's premise that the self is "sovereign and inviolable" and entitled to "his or her own tastes, opinions,
values, etc." Indeed, some have characterized self-actualization as "healthy narcissism"

### Qualities of Self-actualizing People

Maslow realized that the self-actualizing individuals he studied had similar personality traits. All were "reality
centered", able to differentiate what was fraudulent from what was genuine. They were also "problem centered", meaning
that they treated life's difficulties as problems that demanded solutions. These individuals also were comfortable being
alone and had healthy personal relationships. They had only a few close friends and family rather than a large number of
shallow relationships.

Self-actualizing people tend to focus on problems outside themselves; have a clear sense of what is true and what is
false; are spontaneous and creative; and are not bound too strictly by social conventions.

Maslow noticed that self-actualized individuals had a better insight of reality, deeply accepted themselves, others and
the world, and also had faced many problems and were known to be impulsive people. These self-actualized individuals
were very independent and private when it came to their environment and culture, especially their very own individual
development on "potentialities and inner resources".

According to Maslow, self-actualizing people share the following qualities:

- Truth: honest, reality, beauty, pure, clean and unadulterated completeness
- Goodness: rightness, desirability, uprightness, benevolence, honesty
- Beauty: rightness, form, aliveness, simplicity, richness, wholeness, perfection, completion,
- Wholeness: unity, integration, tendency to oneness, interconnectedness, simplicity, organization, structure, order,
  not dissociated, synergy
- Dichotomy-transcendence: acceptance, resolution, integration, polarities, opposites, contradictions
- Aliveness: process, not-deadness, spontaneity, self-regulation, full-functioning
- Uniqueness: idiosyncrasy, individuality, non comparability, novelty
- Perfection: nothing superfluous, nothing lacking, everything in its right place, just-rightness, suitability, justice
- Necessity: inevitability: it must be just that way, not changed in any slightest way
- Completion: ending, justice, fulfillment
- Justice: fairness, suitability, disinterestedness, non partiality,
- Order: lawfulness, rightness, perfectly arranged
- Simplicity: abstract, essential skeletal, bluntness
- Richness: differentiation, complexity, intricacy, totality
- Effortlessness: ease; lack of strain, striving, or difficulty
- Playfulness: fun, joy, amusement
- Self-sufficiency: autonomy, independence, self-determining.

__Maslow based his theory partially on his own assumptions about human potential and partially on his case studies of
historical figures whom he believed to be self-actualized, including Albert Einstein and Abraham Lincoln. Consequently,
Maslow argued, the way in which essential needs are fulfilled is just as important as the needs themselves. Together,
these define the human experience. To the extent a person finds cooperative social fulfillment, he establishes
meaningful relationships with other people and the larger world. In other words, he establishes meaningful connections
to an external reality - an essential component of self-actualization. In contrast, to the extent that vital needs find
selfish and competitive fulfillment, a person acquires hostile emotions and limited external relationships - his
awareness remains internal and limited__.

:::tip[Key Argument of the Book]

__In order for individuals to thrive and excel, a health-fostering culture must be created.__

### Chapter 2 - Focusing on _Problems_ not _Methods_

:::tip[Key Point]

- The essence of science lies in its problems, questions, functions, or goals rather than the instruments, techniques,
  procedures, apparatus, and its methods.
- (I think) This applies to everything from personal development to business

:::

- Means centering tends to push people to become the "apparatus men, "rather than the "question askers" and the problem
  solvers
- Means centering tends strongly to overvalue quantification indiscriminately and as an end in itself
- Means-centered people tends to fit problems to techniques rather than the contrary
- Means-centered culture creates cleavage between teams

If workers looked on themselves as question askers and problem solvers rather than specialized technicians, there would
be more autonomous and creative work outcome that targets more on the _problems_ rathern than the _means_

### Chapter 3 - The 16 Propositions about Motivation 

1. Individual is an integrated, organized whole
2. _Hunger_ is not a paradigm for all other motivations
3. Most of our desires are _means to an end_ rather than _ends in themselves_.

   - This implies that the study of motivation must be in part the study of the ultimate human goals or desires or needs
   - _Means_ are usually conscious while _end_ are often unconscious. They are related in complicated way and we must
     study a person in whole to see their unconscious _end_.

4. (Human desire) _Ends in themselves_ are universal although the _means to these ends_ taken by different people can be
   dramatically different 
5. A conscious act or wish has more than one possible unconscious motivations
6. Motivation never ends, because is keeps triggering other motivations
7. Human being is never satisfied.

   - We must thrive to explore a chain of motivations rather than a single one

8. There is not "list of drives"
9. Instead, there are unconscious fundamental goals/needs
10. Motivation theory must be anthropocentric (human) rather than animalcentric (white rat)
11. Environment shapes motivation
12. Integrated person can behave disintegrated under certain overwhelming situations so that main capacities of the
    person are still left free for the more important or more challenging problems that it faces
13. Not all behaviors are motivation-driven, for example

    - self-actualization
    - growth
    - maturation
    - expression
   
14. Human are wish-realistic
15. Reality shapes the dynamics between Freudian Id and Ego
16. Focusing on healthy person instead of psychotherapists's neurotic sufferers.
