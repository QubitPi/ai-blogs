A Sketch of Kant's View of the Mind
-----------------------------------

In general structure, Kant's model of the mind was the dominant model in the empirical psychology that flowed from his
work and then again, after a hiatus during which behaviourism reigned supreme (roughly 1910 to 1965), toward the end of
the 20th century, especially in cognitive science. Central elements of the models of the mind of thinkers otherwise as
different as Sigmund Freud and Jerry Fodor are broadly Kantian, for example.

Three ideas define the basic shape ('cognitive architecture') of Kant's model and one its dominant method. They have all
become part of the foundation of cognitive science.

1. The mind is a complex set of abilities (functions). (As Meerbote 1989 and many others have observed, Kant held a
   functionalist view of the mind almost 200 years before functionalism was officially articulated in the 1960s by
   Hilary Putnam and others.)
2. The functions crucial for mental, knowledge-generating activity are spatio-temporal processing of, and application of
   concepts to, sensory inputs. Cognition requires concepts as well as percepts.
3. These functions are forms of what Kant called synthesis. Synthesis (and the unity in consciousness required for
   synthesis) are central to cognition.

These three ideas are fundamental to most thinking about cognition now. Kant's most important method, the transcendental
method, is also at the heart of contemporary cognitive science.

- To study the mind, infer the conditions necessary for experience. Arguments having this structure are called
  _transcendental arguments_.

Translated into contemporary terms, the core of this method is inference to the best explanation, the method of
postulating unobservable mental mechanisms in order to explain observed behaviour.
:::

To be sure, Kant thought that he could get more out of his transcendental arguments than just 'best explanations'. He
thought that he could get _a priori_ (experience independent) knowledge out of them. Kant had a tripartite doctrine of
the _a priori_. He held that some features of the mind and its knowledge had _a priori_ origins, i.e., must be in the
mind prior to experience (because using them is necessary to have experience). That mind and knowledge have these
features are _a priori_ truths, i.e., necessary and universal. And we can come to know these truths, or that they are
_a priori_ at any rate, only by using _a priori_ methods, i.e., we cannot learn these things from experience (B3) (Brook
1993). Kant thought that transcendental arguments were _a priori_ or yielded the _a priori_ in all three ways.
Nonetheless, at the heart of this method is inference to the best explanation. When introspection fell out of favour
about 100 years ago, the alternative approach adopted was exactly this approach. Its nonempirical roots in Kant
notwithstanding, it is now the major method used by experimental cognitive scientists.

:::important
Other topics equally central to Kant's approach to the mind have hardly been discussed by cognitive science. These
include a kind of synthesis that for Kant was essential to minds like ours and what struck him as the most striking
features of consciousness of self. Far from his model having been superseded by cognitive science, some things central
to the model have not even been assimilated by it.

Kant's Critical Project and How the Mind Fits Into It
-----------------------------------------------------

The major works so far as Kant's views on the mind are concerned are the monumental __Critique of Pure Reason (CPR)__
and his little, late __Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View__, first published in 1798 only six years before his
death. Kant's view of the mind arose from his
[general philosophical project](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-development/) in CPR the following way. Kant
aimed among other things to,

- Justify our conviction that physics, like mathematics, is a body of necessary and universal truth.
- Insulate religion, including belief in immortality, and free will from the corrosive effects of this very same
  science.

Kant accepted without reservation that “God, freedom and immortality” (1781/7, Bxxx) exist but feared that, if science
were relevant to their existence at all, it would provide reasons to doubt that they exist. As he saw it and very
fortunately, science cannot touch these questions. “I have found it necessary to deny _knowledge_, ... in order to make
room for faith.” (Bxxx, his italics).

Laying the foundation for pursuit of the first aim, which as he saw it was no less than the aim of showing why physics
is a science, was what led Kant to his views about how the mind works. He approached the grounding of physics by asking:
What are the necessary conditions of experience? Put simply, he held that for our experience, and therefore our minds,
to be as they are, the way that our experience is tied together must reflect the way that, according to physics, says
objects in the world must be tied together. Seeing this connection also tells us a lot about what our minds must be
like.

In pursuit of the second aim, Kant criticized some arguments of his predecessors that entailed if sound that we can know
more about the mind's consciousness of itself than Kant could allow. Mounting these criticisms led him to some
extraordinarily penetrating ideas about our consciousness of ourselves.

In CPR, Kant discussed the mind only in connection with his main projects, never in its own right, so his treatment is
remarkably scattered and sketchy. As he put it, “Enquiry … [into] the pure understanding itself, its possibility and the
cognitive faculties upon which it rests ... is of great importance for my chief purpose, ... [but] does not form an
essential part of it” (Axvii). Indeed, Kant offers no sustained, focussed discussion of the mind anywhere in his work
except the popular _Anthropology_.

In addition, the two chapters of CPR in which most of Kant's remarks on the mind occur, the chapter on the
Transcendental Deduction (TD) and the chapter on what he called Paralogisms (faulty arguments about the mind mounted by
his predecessors) were the two chapters that gave him the greatest difficulty. (They contain some of the most
impenetrable prose ever written.) Kant completely rewrote the main body of both chapters for the second edition
(though not the introductions, interestingly).

In the two editions of CPR, there are seven main discussions of the mind. The first is in the Transcendental Aesthetic,
the second is in what is usually called the Metaphysical Deduction. Then there are two discussions of it in the
first-edition TD, in parts 1 to 3 of Section 2 and in the whole of Section 3 and two more in the second-edition TD. The
seventh and last is found in the first edition version of Kant's attack on the Paralogisms, in the course of which he
says things of the utmost interest about consciousness of and reference to self. (What little was retained of these
remarks in the second edition was moved to the completely rewritten TD.) For understanding Kant on the mind and
self-knowledge, the first edition of CPR is far more valuable than the second edition. Kant's discussion proceeds
through the following stages.

### Transcendental Aesthetic

Kant calls the first stage the Transcendental Aesthetic. It is about what space and time must be like, and how we must
handle them, if our experience is to have the spatial and temporal properties that it has. This question about the
necessary conditions of experience is for Kant a 'transcendental' question and the strategy of proceeding by trying to
find answers to such questions is, as we said, the strategy of transcendental argument.

Here Kant advances one of his most notorious views: that whatever it is that impinges on us from the mind-independent
world does not come located in a spatial nor even a temporal matrix (A37=B54fn.). Rather, it is the mind that organizes
this 'manifold of raw intuition', as he called it, spatially and temporally. The mind has two pure forms of intuition,
space and time, built into it to allow it to do so. ('Pure' means 'not derived from experience'.)

### Metaphysical Deduction

The Aesthetic is about the conditions of experience, Kant's official project. The chapter leading up to the
Transcendental Deduction, The Clue to the Discovery of All Pure Concepts of the Understanding has a very different
starting point.

Starting from Aristotelian logic (the syllogisms and the formal concepts that Aristotle called _categories_), Kant
proceeds by analysis to draw out the implications of these concepts and syllogisms for the conceptual structure (the
“function of thought in judgment”) within which all thought and experience must take place. The result is what Kant
called the Categories. That is to say, Kant tries to deduce the conceptual structure of experience from the components
of Aristotelian logic.

**Thus, in Kant's thought about the mind early in CPR, there is not one central movement but two, one in the
Transcendental Aesthetic and the other in the Metaphysical Deduction. The first is a move up from experience (of
objects) to the necessary conditions of such experience. The second is a move down from the Aristotelian functions of
judgment to the concepts that we have to use in judging, namely, the Categories. One is inference up from experience,
the other deduction down from conceptual structures of the most abstract kind.**

### Transcendental Deduction, 1st Edition

Then we get to the second chapter of the Transcendental Logic, the brilliant and baffling Transcendental Deduction (TD).
Recall the two movements just discussed, the one from experience to its conditions and the one from Aristotelian
functions of judgment to the concepts that we must use in all judging (the Categories). This duality led Kant to his
famous question of right (_quid juris_): with what right do we apply the Categories, which are not acquired from
experience, to the contents of experience?. Kant's problem here is not as arcane as it might seem. It reflects an
important question: How is it that the world as we experience it conforms to our logic? In briefest form, Kant thought
that the trick to showing how it is possible for the Categories to apply to experience is to show that it is _necessary_
that they apply.

TD has two sides, though Kant never treats them separately. He once called them the objective and the subjective
deductions. The objective deduction is about the conceptual and other cognitive conditions of having representations of
objects. It is Kant's answer to the quid juris question. Exactly how the objective deduction goes is highly
controversial, a controversy that we will sidestep here. The subjective deduction is about what the mind, the
“subjective sources” of understanding, must as a consequence be like. The subjective deduction is what mainly interests
us.

_Kant argues as follows. Our experiences have objects, that is, they are about something. The objects of our experiences
are discrete, unified particulars. To have such particulars available to it, the mind must construct them based on
sensible input. To construct them, the mind must do three kinds of synthesis. It must generate temporal and spatial
structure (Synthesis of Apprehension in Intuition). It must associate spatio-temporally structured items with other
spatio-temporally structured items (Synthesis of Reproduction in the Imagination). And it must recognize items using
concepts, the Categories in particular (Synthesis of Recognition in a Concept)_. This threefold doctrine of synthesis is
one of the cornerstones of Kant's model of the mind. We will consider it in more detail in the next Section.

The 'deduction of the categories' should now be complete. Strangely enough, the chapter has only nicely got started. In
the first edition version, for example, we have only reached about one-third of the way through the chapter. At this
point, Kant introduces the notion of transcendental apperception for the first time and the unity of such apperception,
the unity of consciousness. Evidently, something is happening (something, moreover, not at all well heralded in the
text)

We can now understand in more detail why Kant said that the subjective deduction is inessential. Since the objective
deduction is about the conditions of representations having objects, a better name for it might have been 'deduction of
the object'. Similarly, a better name for the subjective deduction might have been 'the deduction of the subject' or
'the deduction of the subject's nature'. The latter enquiry was inessential to Kant's main critical project because the
main project was to defend the synthetic _a priori_ credentials of physics in the objective deduction. From this point
of view, anything uncovered about the nature and functioning of the mind was a happy accident.

### Attack on the Paralogisms, 1st Edition

The chapter on the Paralogisms, the first of the three parts of Kant's second project, contains Kant's most original
insights into the nature of consciousness of the self. In the first edition, he seems to have achieved a stable position
on self-consciousness only as late as this chapter. Certainly his position was not stable in TD. Even his famous term
for consciousness of self, 'I think', occurs for the first time only in the introduction to the chapter on the
Paralogisms. His target is claims that we know what the mind is like. Whatever the merits of Kant's attack on these
claims, in the course of mounting it, he made some very deep-running observations about consciousness and knowledge of
self.

:::tip
To summarize: in the first edition, TD contains most of what Kant had to say about synthesis and unity, but little on
the nature of consciousness of self. The chapter on the Paralogisms contains most of what he has to say about
consciousness of self.

### The Two Discussions in the 2nd-edition TD and Other Discussions

In other new material prepared for the second edition, we find a first gloss on the topic of self-consciousness as early
as the Aesthetic (B68). The mind also appears in a new passage called the Refutation of Idealism, where Kant attempts to
tie the possibility of one sort of consciousness of self to consciousness of permanence in something other than
ourselves, in a way he thought to be inconsistent with Berkeleian idealism. This new Refutation of Idealism has often
been viewed as a replacement for the argument against the Fourth Paralogism of the first edition.

Elsewhere in his work, the only sustained discussion of the mind and consciousness is, as we said, his little, late
__Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View__. By 'anthropology' Kant meant the study of human beings from the point of
view of their (psychologically-controlled) behaviour, especially their behaviour toward one another, and of the things
revealed in behaviour such as character. Though Kant sometimes contrasted anthropology as a legitimate study with what
he understood empirical psychology to be, namely, psychology based on introspective observation, he meant by
anthropology something fairly close to what we now mean by behavioural or experimental psychology.

Kant's View of the Mind
-----------------------

### Method

Turning now to Kant's view of the mind, we will start with a point about method: Kant held surprisingly strong and not
entirely consistent views on the empirical study of the mind. The empirical method for doing psychology that Kant
discussed was introspection.

Sometimes he held such study to be hopeless. The key text on psychology is in **The Metaphysical Foundations of Natural
Science**. There Kant tell us that “the empirical doctrine of the soul … must remain even further removed than chemistry
from the rank of what may be called a natural science proper”. (In Kant's defence, there was nothing resembling a single
unified theory of chemical reactions in his time.) The contents of introspection, in his terms inner sense, cannot be
studied scientifically for at least 5 reasons.

1. Having only one universal dimension and one that they are only represented to have at that, namely, distribution in
   time, the contents of inner sense cannot be quantified; thus no mathematical model of them is possible.
2. “The manifold of internal observation is separated only by mere thought”. That is to say, only the introspective
   observer distinguishes the items one from another; there are no real distinctions among the items themselves.
3. These items “cannot be kept separate” in a way that would allow us to connect them again “at will”, by which Kant
   presumably means, according to the dictates of our developing theory.
4. “Another thinking subject does not submit to our investigations in such a way as to be conformable to our purposes” -
   the only thinking subject whose inner sense one can investigate is oneself.
5. “Even the observation itself alters and distorts the state of the object observed”. Indeed, introspection can be bad
   for the health: it is a road to “mental illness” ('Illuminism and Terrorism', 1798, Ak. VII:133; see 161).

In these critical passages, it is not clear why he didn't respect what he called anthropology more highly as an
empirical study of the mind, given that he himself did it. He did so elsewhere. In the Anthropology, for example, he
links 'self-observation' and observation of others and calls them both sources of anthropology

Whatever, no kind of empirical psychology can yield necessary truths about the mind. In the light of this limitation,
how _should_ we study the mind? Kant's answer was: _transcendental method using transcendental arguments_ (notions
introduced earlier). If we cannot observe the connections among the denizens of inner sense to any purpose, we can study
what the mind _must_ be like and what capacities and structures (in Kant's jargon, faculties) it _must_ have if it is to
represent things as it does. With this method we can find universally true, that is to say, 'transcendental'
psychological propositions. We have already seen what some of them are: minds must be able to synthesize and minds must
have a distinctive unity, for example. Let us turn now to these substantive claims.

### Synthesis and Faculties

We have already discussed Kant's view of the mind's handling of space and time, so we can proceed directly to his
doctrine of synthesis. As Kant put it in one of his most famous passages, “__Concepts without intuitions are empty,
intuitions without concepts are blind__”. Experience requires both percepts and concepts. As we might say now, to
discriminate, we need information; but for information to be of any use to us, we must organize the information. This
organization is provided by acts of synthesis.

> By _synthesis_, in its most general sense, I understand the act of putting different representations together, and of
> grasping what is manifold in them in one knowledge

If the doctrine of space and time is the first major part of his model of the mind, the doctrine of synthesis is the
second. Kant claimed, as we saw earlier, that three kinds of synthesis are required to organize information, namely
apprehending in intuition, reproducing in imagination, and recognizing in concepts. Each of the three kinds of synthesis
relates to a different aspect of Kant's fundamental duality of intuition and concept. Synthesis of apprehension concerns
raw perceptual input, synthesis of recognition concerns concepts, and synthesis of reproduction in imagination allows
the mind to go from the one to the other.

They also relate to three fundamental faculties of the mind. One is the province of Sensibility, one is the province of
Understanding, and the one in the middle is the province of a faculty that has a far less settled position than the
other two, namely, Imagination

The first two, apprehension and reproduction, are inseparable; one cannot occur without the other. The third,
recognition, requires the other two but is not required by them. It seems that only the third requires the use of
concepts; this problem of non-concept-using syntheses and their relationship to use of the categories becomes a
substantial issue in the second edition, where Kant tries to save the universality of the objective deduction by arguing
that all three kinds of syntheses are required to represent objects.

Acts of synthesis are performed on that to which we are passive in experience, namely intuitions (_Anschauungen_).
Intuitions are quite different from sense-data as classically understood; we can become conscious of intuitions only
after acts of synthesis and only by inference from these acts, not directly. Thus they are something more like
theoretical entities (better, events) postulated to explain something in what we do recognize. What they explain is the
non-conceptual element in representations, an element over which we have no control. Intuitions determine how our
representations will serve to confirm or refute theories, aid or impede our efforts to reach various goals.
