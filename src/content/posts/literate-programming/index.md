I was studying Jupyter Documentation and stumbled upon [this article](https://jupyter-docs.qubitpi.org/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)
which introduced to me the first time __[Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)__.

I [read about it](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf) and ended up couldn't agree with it more. Literate
Programming significantly improves documentation of programs for human by concentrating on explaining to _human beings_
what we want a computer to do.

The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and
excellence of style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what
each variable means. He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in
an order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce each other.

As a leader who has been a beneficiary of excellent code readability and maintainability, it is my responsibility to
coach my team to follow the same practice of Literate Programming.

Literate Programming has her perfect fit in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-docs.qubitpi.org)

- [Write the Docs](https://qubitpi.github.io/writethedocs/) focuses on how a programmer writes better documentations
- [Clean code](https://trello.com/c/5W6W5T0b) goes deeper in a systematic way

Those above are for engineers. But how about the manager or leader to leads the team? How would we boost a proactive
mindset among the team where each one of them has the consciousness?

To be continued...
